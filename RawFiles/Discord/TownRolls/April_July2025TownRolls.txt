Doing Alchemy for another Minor Healing potion
dripton (GM) — 4/20/2025 2:50 PM
Failure, 10% extra cost
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 4/20/2025 9:17 PM
Research roll this week will be focused on the ghost in the tower
dripton (GM) — 4/20/2025 9:23 PM
You find a record of that guard tower's creation.  It's about 250 years old, and was built by Archon Adrienic, sent by Emperor Phocion IV to retake Archon Vul.  This expedition was massacred.  The tower was abandoned after the survivors fled.  Some locals claim the tower is haunted, but the author says that's just folklore.
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 4/20/2025 9:23 PM
It seems this author is full of it
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 4/23/2025 7:20 PM
What's the availability roll to get a healer's kit?
dripton (GM) — 4/23/2025 8:08 PM
There is no roll out of play.  You can check the pawn shop in play.
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 4/25/2025 11:08 PM
As stated aloud, Ioannes's Research roll this week is focused on Roskelly and his gang of little not-Fonzies
dripton (GM) — 4/25/2025 11:10 PM
Nothing
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 4/25/2025 11:10 PM
dang
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 4/27/2025 3:41 PM
Ioannes will brew paut this week
dripton (GM) — 4/27/2025 3:44 PM
success!
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 5/11/2025 1:59 PM
Ioannes will brew a major healing potion this week
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 5/11/2025 3:01 PM
Research roll this week will be focused on the apes/ape level
dripton (GM) — 5/11/2025 5:10 PM
Potion: success
Research: You didn't find anything interesting
Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 5/15/2025 7:55 PM
Vallium has 3 outstanding Carousing+2 rolls (pre-May 2nd, pre-May 9th, pre-May 16th sessions).
dripton (GM) — 5/15/2025 7:56 PM
Pre May 9 you were in the dungeon, but during May 9 I'll allow it.
Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 5/15/2025 7:58 PM
Sure, I meant during the week that occurred on May 9th between Session 8b and Session 9.
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 5/17/2025 11:14 PM
Ioannes's Research roll this week will again be focused on Roskelly and the Doomed Bunch of Halflings
He will also brew a major healing potion this week
dripton (GM) — 5/18/2025 9:51 AM
You fail to find any information on the halflings.  You do however manage to get a major healing potion at the discount price.
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 5/24/2025 6:52 PM
Ioannes will Research the statue with the empty eyes
dripton (GM) — 5/24/2025 6:55 PM
The statue resembles The Philosopher, a classic Archontean archetype, except for the empty eyes.
Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 5/29/2025 5:14 PM
Vallium has two Carousing+2 rolls (post Session 10 and 11 respectively) unresolved. He'll also try to find a book re: mushrooms at Astableon's.
dripton (GM) — 5/29/2025 5:19 PM
Vallium found two rumors.  Sadly, while Astableon knows of a field guide to mushrooms, he does not currently have any books about mushrooms in stock.
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 6/2/2025 12:07 AM
Ioannes will brew a greater healing potion this week (or for next, as the case may be)
dripton (GM) — 6/2/2025 9:26 AM
Success, Greater Healing potion acquired at discount. 
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 6/3/2025 7:48 PM
Ioannes will direct his Research at the tower and ghost again
dripton (GM) — 6/3/2025 7:56 PM
Ioannes finds a book about ghosts at the Temple of Mitra.  It says that ghosts are real and that they are typically left by someone who died horribly or with an important task uncompleted.  It states that some ghosts are relatively benign, while others are very dangerous.  It also says that turning or even destroying them is usually only temporary and they will often return to their haunted spot until their death is avenged, their task completed, their body properly blessed and buried, etc.  It says that giving a good ghost a proper rest is a blessed deed worthy of a paladin of Mitra, in part because of the danger and in part because each ghost needs different treatment.
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 6/3/2025 9:22 PM
So like Final Rest?
dripton (GM) — 6/3/2025 9:23 PM
It doesn't say
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 6/13/2025 8:43 AM
Ioannes will direct his Research at the Great Caverns, and will brew a Strength potion
dripton (GM) — 6/13/2025 9:23 AM
Research: success, new rumor found.  Alchemy: fail, +10% price.
Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 6/13/2025 9:51 AM
Vallium spent $500 for a +3 to his Carousing roll (re: Newmarket), but did you say you wanted to resolve all the Newmarket things at the table?
dripton (GM) — 6/13/2025 10:14 AM
Yeah, we'll do the Newmarket trip in the first few minutes tonight.
(For the PCs who are back anyway; Vael and Michael can resolve theirs later.)
Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 6/19/2025 7:07 PM
Vallium will spend $125 to have a Carousing+2 roll.  Vallium has learned Alchemy-7, and will brew an Agility potion.
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 6/19/2025 7:10 PM
Glad I waited before I hit return earlier! Ioannes will brew Strength (note increased Alchemy for heightened IQ) and research the Great Caverns again (again, heightened IQ raises Research)
dripton (GM) — 6/19/2025 7:26 PM
Alchemy: Vallium success (beginner's luck) -> discount, Ioannes failure -> surcharge.
Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 6/26/2025 10:33 AM
Vallium will brew an Invisibility potion.  Vallium will spend $125 to have a Carousing+2 roll.  Moving forward, any critical successes for Carousing rumors should be directed toward the Tower of the Ape in Newmarket.
dripton (GM) — 6/26/2025 11:28 AM
Alchemy: fail, pay extra, you needed to call in Ioannes for help when you measured your ingredients wrong.
Carousing: rumor generated, see PM
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 6/26/2025 11:44 AM
Ioannes will brew a Strength potion, and research the Scorpion Statue
dripton (GM) — 6/26/2025 11:50 AM
Alchemy: success, you get the discount.
Research: You find nothing on the teleporting scorpion statue in particular.  You do find something related; see PM.
Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 7/2/2025 9:16 PM
Vallium will brew a Fire Resistance potion.  Vallium will spend $125 to have a Carousing +2 roll.  Vallium will try to find a Potion Belt to purchase, which requires an availability roll?
dripton (GM) — 7/2/2025 9:29 PM
Alchemy: failure, pay extra
Carousing: rumor generated, see PM
Potion belt: Creon's Curios doesn't have one.  You visit the Totsday market, but there are no peddlers, only food stands.  They tell you to maybe try the market again on Demmasday.
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 7/11/2025 6:37 PM
Ioannes will brew a Strength potion and focus his Research on the location with Roskelly
dripton (GM) — 7/11/2025 6:39 PM
Alchemy: fail, pay extra
Research: success, see PM
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 7/13/2025 7:56 PM

dripton (GM) — 7/13/2025 10:02 PM
Alchemy: success, discount
Research: got a rumor
Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 7/14/2025 9:25 PM
Vallium will brew a Magebane grenade.  Vallium will spend $125 to have a Carousing +2 roll.  Vallium will try to find a Potion Belt to purchase.
dripton (GM) — 7/14/2025 10:37 PM
Alchemy: failed, pay extra
Carousing: rumor in PM
dripton (GM) — 7/14/2025 10:58 PM
Creon's did not have a potion belt this week.

And he'll also do Research on the library
Archon Shiva (Grudge Brigade) — 7/30/2025 9:55 AM
He’d be a lot more successful if he did research at the library.
dripton (GM) — 7/30/2025 10:23 AM
You find a claim that the Library of Thoth is located near the Well of Light, and that it contains much lost and valuable knowledge, but that nobody has actually reached it in recent years due to undead guards.
