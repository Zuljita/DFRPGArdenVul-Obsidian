Ioannes will brew a Flight potion. He will also Research Androsia.

Alchemy: success, discounted price.
Research: You didn't find the name Androsia anywhere.
Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 10/8/2025 6:49 PM
Vallium will brew a Flight Potion.  Vallium will spend $125 to have a Carousing +2 roll.  Vallium would like to see if he can purchase a standard pair of Shackles and is also interested in seeing if Shackles appropriate for a SM-2/SM-1/SM+1 humanoids are available.

Alchemy: failure, pay extra
Carousing: A weird goblin prophet named Gislu has been spotted near the Forum of Set. He's looking for some ancient goblin artifact and is sure that the object is located near the Set shrine.
You do not find any shackles.
While searching for shackles at the Demmasday market, you find 200 Dwarven Rations and a Bit and Brace.
@Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) Vael gets a tip from Creon that a potion of Frost Cage is available for $500.
Archon Shiva (Grudge Brigade) — 10/8/2025 7:36 PM
Buy now, analyze later?
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 10/8/2025 8:23 PM
Yes, very yes.  I'll buy that for $500
I'd love to know what it does too

Carousing: Bands of lizardmen exit the Halls via a cave halfway up the cliff face, to the left of the waterfall. They lay fiendish traps along the Swift River and take unwary captives back to their lair to be eaten.  (You heard this from a Thorcin fighter named Roscoe, who claimed firsthand knowledge.)
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 10/17/2025 2:36 PM
Ioannes will brew a Flight potion. He will Research the dragon.

dripton (GM) — 10/17/2025 2:56 PM
Research: You read an account from about 50 years ago.  A group of the late Lord Burdock's men-at-arms climbed the cliff face to explore the ruins of Arden Vul, met a huge green dragon, and 10 out of the 12 men, including three knights, died.  (The only survivors were two young men who were kept back to hold horses, and they lost most of the horses and baggage as they fled.)  Lord Burdock then forbade any more of his subjects from going up the Long Stair to the ruins, lest they anger the dragon further.  He also discouraged outsiders from using the Burdock Valley as a base for exploration of the ruins.  So there was apparently very little exploration of the ruins until his death 25 years ago.
Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 10/23/2025 10:55 AM
Vallium will brew an Agility Potion.  Vallium will attempt to visit a locksmith to have copies made of Plumthorn's keys. Can Vallium spend $500 on barrels (as in DFRPG sized barrels that hold 4 gallons) of alcohol, with the intent of using them with the goblins for an in-game Carousing roll for rumours, in lieu of the once-per-downtime Carousing roll for rumours?
dripton (GM) — 10/23/2025 10:58 AM
Alchemy: fail, lots of smoke, small fire, Lyssandra now wants either Ioannes or Vael supervising Vallium's potion making attempts until he gets a bit better at it.  Pay extra.
Locksmith: You find one and get him to copy Plumthorn's keys.  This costs $10 per key, $30 total for his 3 keys.
Carousing: Yes, you can buy $500 of alcohol.  You can attempt Carousing in-game with the goblins instead of during downtime.
(Note that $500 of alcohol varies from a single bottle to many barrels, depending on quality.)
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 10/23/2025 11:02 AM
(Vael still doesn't know alchemy but maybe I'll pick it up this week after all)
Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 10/23/2025 11:02 AM
Vallium is going for quantity in this case.  Moonshine and rotgut,  so long as it won't make anyone blind.
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 10/23/2025 11:03 AM
500 in beer might go really long way
Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 10/23/2025 11:03 AM
Haha, even an untrained Vael supervising Vallium is preferable to having him brew solo.
dripton (GM) — 10/23/2025 11:04 AM
Lyssandra seems to be a magical snob so she just assumes someone with as much magery as Vael must be good at everything.
Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 10/23/2025 11:04 AM
As per DFRPG spending $125 gives you +2 to Carousing rolls and $500 gives +3.
Archon Shiva (Grudge Brigade) — 10/23/2025 11:17 AM
Soon.
dripton (GM) — 10/23/2025 11:20 AM
Knowing Purify Air isn't quite the same as knowing Alchemy, but if the goal is to avoid stinking up the whole establishment, it's close enough.
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 10/23/2025 11:22 AM
Alchemy 10+2 (Bless), please gimme a Death Potion please.
dripton (GM) — 10/23/2025 11:33 AM
Success; 20% off. 
Archon Shiva (Grudge Brigade) — 10/23/2025 11:39 AM
Not 20%?
dripton (GM) — 10/23/2025 11:40 AM
Sorry; it's -20% or +10%.
(Unless crit.)
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 10/25/2025 11:18 PM
Another Death Potion please
dripton (GM) — 10/25/2025 11:19 PM
I thought you weren't playing this week.
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 10/25/2025 11:19 PM
I'm not.  Just trying to get ahead for whenever I do play.  This is me just making sure I don't have to think again between now and 11/6
You're also about to get my next sheet.
dripton (GM) — 10/25/2025 11:20 PM
Alchemy: success, discount achieved
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 10/25/2025 11:21 PM
Although, I'm happy to spend the week I'm out travelling to new market with a test rug, especially if someone else is going to miss a week.
dripton (GM) — 10/25/2025 11:22 PM
I'm not okaying any weird downtime activities, because I don't know if we actually have an extra week of downtime yet.
If we don't get quorum then the world just freezes.
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 10/25/2025 11:22 PM
No worries, just throwing out ideas.
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 10/29/2025 11:47 AM
Ioannes is going to Research those Rugs.
dripton (GM) — 10/29/2025 11:54 AM
Research: Ioannes finds a reference to the story of Sligo the Devious gifting a Rug of Instant Access as a peace offering to Leonidas of Archontos, then having a team of assassins come through the Rug in the middle of the night and kill Leonidas.  Sligo was convicted of murder and sentenced to death by Emperor Basil, who also confiscated the Rugs and banned enchanting more.  This all happened in Archontos about 1400 years ago.  Carpets are still not given as gifts in the Empire, and rug-weavers have the slogan "A Carpet Is Forever" to encourage the wealthy to only use custom-made carpets and never buy used carpets.
Cosmo (Uvash)

 — 10/29/2025 11:59 AM
Uvash is going to proselytize to try to convert one or two possible prospects to the Church of Zorradrim (which, is currently a small cottage most likely…).
dripton (GM) — 10/29/2025 12:01 PM
Uvash did not find a convert this week.  Most of the small dwarven population of Gosterwick are already members of Uvash's flock, though only about half of them come regularly.  He also has a couple of humans.
Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 10/30/2025 3:54 PM
Vallium will (under supervision) brew a Paut Potion.  Vallium have copies made of all of the party's keys, except for the elaborate bronze key and 1-inch bronze keys (22 keys + however many keys are on Gerrilad's keyring). Vallium will spend $125 to have a Carousing +2 roll.
dripton (GM) — 10/30/2025 3:54 PM
Gerrilad had 3 keys, total 25 keys, $250 for copies
dripton (GM) — 10/30/2025 4:02 PM
Carousing: Vallium meets a Thorcin adventurer named Iris who is part of a group called Second Chance.  She says that one of the knights in the amazing armor - you know, the ones with the pale, scarred faces -stopped us and demanded to know if we had seen one of her companions, a knight named Sixth. Said their Order would pay good money for knowledge of his whereabouts.
Alchemy: failure, extra cost
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 10/30/2025 11:59 PM
Ioannes will brew a greater healing potion
dripton (GM) — 10/31/2025 12:00 AM
Alchemy: Critical Failure!  Money gone, no potion, and Lyssandra isn't happy about the mess and tells you to supervise Vallium more closely.
