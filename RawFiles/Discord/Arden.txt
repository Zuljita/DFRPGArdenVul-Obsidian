You read several books on Arden.  She is one of the 20 Worthies of the Empire.  She lived around 2100 years ago, though some humans claim she never actually died but rather ascended to demi-godhood.  (This is clearly nonsense, showing that the historical record has been somewhat corrupted over time.)  She and her partner Vul the Sorcerer discovered the cliff and cavern systems that are now the Halls of Arden Vul.  Arden famously completed the 12 Labors, such as defeating owlbears and trolls and undead and dragons and Wiskin berserkers.  Though really only 11 Labors are detailed; the 12th is "still to be done at the time of the Empire's Need."  At the height of their power, Arden and Vul mysteriously disappeared and their bodies were never found.  The city that was later founded above the Halls was named after them.  There was a Cult of Arden among the military officials in Arden Vul, and is is claimed they built their own headquarters in the Halls and attempted to replicate the Labors of Arden.

Whoever keeps track of that stuff, you should acquire a copy of The Twelve Labours of Arden to guide you in the puzzle that starts with purification at the fountain underneath the waterfall.
