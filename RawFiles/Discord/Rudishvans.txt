We ask Akla-Chan about burial/funeral rites for rudishva (re: corpse), and show her the glyph that we found on the stone seat.

The Rudishva have a few different funeral traditions.  She says Full Recycling is the best but the Beacon currently lacks the ability.  She says Spacing is the second best but the Beacon currently lacks that ability too.  She says Cremation is the third best and might be practical if you have the means to build a suitably hot fire, somewhere outside the Beacon.
