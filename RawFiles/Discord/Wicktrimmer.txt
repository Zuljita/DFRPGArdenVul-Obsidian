Lyssandra knocks on the alchemy lab door and tells Vael and Ioannis that a messenger brought her a note.  She shows it to you.  It says "My sources tell me that a very large quantity of Arcanum just showed up in your corner of town.  If it's available for sale, tell whoever brought it to bring it to me at the Rarities Factor.  If only some of it is available, I'll take what I can get.  -- Wicktrimmer"
She says "I'm pretty sure Wicktrimmer's not a wizard.  I wonder who he's trying to sell it to?"
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 7/13/2025 10:49 AM
“Who is Wicktrimmer?”
dripton (GM) — 7/13/2025 10:49 AM
"The goblin who runs the rarities factor?  Probably the second richest person in Gosterwick."
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 7/13/2025 10:50 AM
“Oh, goodness! Please don’t answer for a moment, we need to get a read on this.”
OOC, Zaber to Seep: “Hey, another Wickprick! Let’s get him a camel!”
dripton (GM) — 7/13/2025 10:55 AM
"Oh, it's not my Arcanum, so I'm not the one who has to give him an answer.  Just, if you turn him down, be nice about it.  You don't want him mad at you."
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 7/13/2025 10:58 AM
“I understand. How much do you know about arcanum? What can someone do with it?”
dripton (GM) — 7/13/2025 11:00 AM
"I've heard it's a magic orange metal that is found within Arden Vul and can be used as a spell component, but I've never actually seen any before."
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/14/2025 9:57 PM
Vael would like to ask around using the people and skills he used to develop streetwise and merchant, as well as his usual friends like Creon about Wicktrimmer, Lost and Found and the Rarities factor, their reputation, their capabilites, their trustworthiness and so on.  Just trying to do his due dilligence.
(He won't go anywhere alone though)
(he'll also be wearing the Larel cloak)
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/14/2025 10:15 PM
and the amulet of voice.
dripton (GM) — 9/14/2025 10:15 PM
You learn the following: Wicktrimmer is a retired adventurer, who used to plunder Arden Vul with a group called Lost and Found.  Lost and Found was led by the wizard Balthazar the Blue and the paladin Grimley.  Wicktrimmer founded the Rarities Factor in Gosterwick 12 years ago, then expanded to another location in Newmarket, then a third location in Narsileon.  They provide the same services (banking, letters, mule caravans) as the other Factors, but at a slightly cheaper price, and a smaller geographical range.  He is possibly the second richest person in Gosterwick, and definitely the richest goblin.  He is a collector of both historical treasures and magic items.  He is apparently friends with all the other important people in Gosterwick, such as the Green Lady.  His reputation is very solid.  He seems to know everything that happens in town, and everyone has a different theory why.

dripton (GM) — 9/13/2025 10:14 AM
While you are all in the Arcane Practitioners Club, a note arrives.  It is addressed to "Right for Riches Company".  It says "I have reliable information that you found some magical artifacts of deep historical significance.  If my wizard identifies them as genuine, and you sell any of them to me, I will include lifetime free banking at the Rarities Factor.  Drop by the Rarities Factor if interested.  -- Wicktrimmer"


dripton (GM) — 9/14/2025 8:56 PM
Okay, Vael and some friends visit the Rarities Factor.  Wicktrimmer accepts your visit.  He thanks you for your visit and asks if his wizard (who you have not previously met) can thoroughly inspect this letter opener in your presence.  Are you okay with that?
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/14/2025 8:56 PM
Sure but I'll warn him it's got obfuscation on it and that it took me multiple tries to get all the data.
dripton (GM) — 9/14/2025 8:57 PM
He and the wizard both nod.
The wizard starts casting what looks like Analyze Magic while you continue your discussion.
Wicktrimmer is not willing to discuss the exact source of his information but says it's his job to know of every magic item that shows up in Gosterwick, so he has some magical means of finding out about any new interesting ones.  And that the ones you recently brought in were extra confusing, possibly due to this concealing effect.
You see the wizard poke the letter opener into a bag of flour and destroy it.
Wicktrimmer asks if you are looking to sell any other items you recently acquired and says he would love a matched set.
The wizard writes down some observations.
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/14/2025 9:00 PM
I'll inform him that we'll keep that in mind if we ever have any matched items to sell.
dripton (GM) — 9/14/2025 9:01 PM
He nods and asks if you're willing to discuss how deep you were when you found such amazing items.  He says "I used to be an adventurer, but then my party leader got married and had a kid and his wife wouldn't let him."
"So now I'm a merchant."
He says his company, Lost and Found, made it all the way to the Obsidian Gates, but not beyond them.
The wizard whispers something in his ear.  He says "I'll give you $20000 plus free banking for life for your entire company.  If you keep finding good stuff like this, having the best vault in town to put it in is valuable."
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/14/2025 9:04 PM
We've seen the entrance to where we were told the gates were, but had other things on our mind and left it be.  We've been a whole lot of places in Arden Vul, down the well of light, through the howling caves, and more besides...
dripton (GM) — 9/14/2025 9:04 PM
Wicktrimmer nods.  "I hate baboons."
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/14/2025 9:05 PM
They hate us now, mostly cower.
dripton (GM) — 9/14/2025 9:05 PM
He looks impressed.
"Some kind of fear spell?  Or do you have a druid?"
"We never brought a druid."
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/14/2025 9:06 PM
repeated lessons in pain.
dripton (GM) — 9/14/2025 9:07 PM
He asks if you want payment in gold, silver, platinum, gems, or a letter of deposit.  Or if you want your letter opener back to think about it.
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/14/2025 9:09 PM
So, I suspect it's worth even more than you're offering, but that I'm unlikely to get a better offer in Gosterwick.  I need to confer with my compatriots as well.  Are you able to offer any other benefits?  Maybe right of first refusal for any magic items you decide you're willing to sell?  Also, we have enemies who may come for our posessions in particular.  Are you prepared to deal with that?
dripton (GM) — 9/14/2025 9:11 PM
He laughs.  He says "we have the most secure vault in Gosterwick.  Zero thefts so far, in 12 years.  Ask the Green Lady if you don't believe me."
He says "Lady Alexia already has that right of first refusal so I can't sell it again, sorry."
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/14/2025 9:12 PM
Our enemies did murder just last week in Gosterwick to send us a message.  We made them pay by the score in return, but they persist.  It's going to be a long campaign.
Right of second refusal?
dripton (GM) — 9/14/2025 9:13 PM
"A certain noble in Narsileon has that."
"I'll tell you how to earn right of third refusal.  Get me a reliable source of teleportation with a 400 mile range."
"Mule trains suck."
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/14/2025 9:14 PM
What about concierge shopping service on the other end of the mule trains?
If I had such a source of teleportation, I'd be starting a new business.
dripton (GM) — 9/14/2025 9:15 PM
He laughs.  "Yes, if you had that ability you would have the start of a business.  But it's a grind.  You need secure buildings at both ends, guards you can trust, wizards you can trust..."
He says that he can get messages to and from Narsileon in less than a day, but items travel at mule train speed.  So in theory if you wanted to buy something there and knew exactly what you wanted he could ask the question that day, get an answer back the next day, and if everyone was in agreement you would have the item within a month.  As long as it fit on a mule.  Anything that needed a barge would be slower.
He says that he knows one wizard who can fly to Narsileon but that guy is too expensive for courier service.
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/14/2025 9:20 PM
We can do that, I can also give you a list of items we're on the lookout for and if your people find any of them, just buy them and we can make you whole.
dripton (GM) — 9/14/2025 9:22 PM
He says he can do that, if yon can provide exact specifications.  He says you get the standard rate for mule shipping.  He says that not everything is available in Narsileon, but it's a whole lot better than Gosterwick or Newmarket.
He says that you have to pay the cost of the Analyze Magic to make sure the item is legit though.
He doesn't want you to get ripped off and blame him.
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/14/2025 9:24 PM
Sure. Happy to do that. or offer services in kind here in Gosterwick if you ever need a second or third opinion.  All due respect to master... I didn't catch your name?
(directed at the wizard)
dripton (GM) — 9/14/2025 9:24 PM
The wizard looks up and says "ingimund of Arcturus, pleased to meet you."
"Also I wasn't here.  I'm in Newmarket right now."
Wicktrimmer starts writing up a contract.  It says "Right for Riches sells Larel's Pin to Rarities Factor for $20000, free banking/vault services for life of the current 5 members, and the right to send one scroll per month of up to 5 items via Message to Rarities Factor in Newmarket and Narsileon, authorizing purchase of such items, identification of such items, and mule train shipping of such items, up to the amount deposited by those 5 members in Rarities Factor accounts."
He asks if you want a group account or 5 individual accounts.
He asks if the contract is acceptable.
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/14/2025 9:31 PM
(I'm still actively writing my proposal bear with me)
Here's what I'm thinking all told: we sell you the letter opener, right of first refusal to buy our magic items with the exception of a short list of items that the lady has asked for personally.  We also reserve the right to give items that seem otherwise worthwhile to certain important figures additionally, to barter for unique goods or services, or pay adventuring companions in-kind.  We're willing to inform you of any items we give or trade away, as well as items we've already given or traded away.

In return, you offer the following:
twenty thousand silver for the truly unique magic item
Concierge shopping services in Narselion, Newmarket and anywhere else you have agents at your cost,
free banking with the rarities factor
reports on the doings of our enemies in town (since you seem to be so well informed), especially the cult of set.
none of which should cost you anything significant, but strengthens our partnership. 
I want to talk through that offer with my team, but I think it's mutually beneficial, and if we both hold up our ends, could be a great ongoing partnership.
dripton (GM) — 9/14/2025 9:38 PM
He says "This is acceptable as a first draft.  Talk to your companions.  Also don't sell anything else you found with this to anyone else.  If there's something you insist on keeping, for now, fine.  But don't sell it.  And if there's something else you don't want and it's not worth much, throw it in with this, so I have the collection."
"Also, when you retire, if I'm still around, sell me the other 2 items I think you have."
"Finally, if you find a teleporter or a fast flying carpet, I am the one you want to talk to."
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/14/2025 9:41 PM
I think the right of first refusal would cover any other items we might have found with this that seem to be of value.
If we're selling them, you'd be the first to know. 
dripton (GM) — 9/14/2025 9:41 PM
"Right, I meant non-magical stuff too.  If you found Larel's Mom's Rabbit Soup Recipe, I want it."
"This is not business.  It's personal.  I've had a 20-year argument with my best friend Balthazar that Larel is real.  He is going to utterly die when I show him this Pin."
"Oh, if you don't sell it to me, at least bring it back to show to Balthazar, next time he's in town."
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/14/2025 9:43 PM
I think that's an easy thing to add to the partnership.
I'll depart to confer with the whole company.
dripton (GM) — 9/14/2025 9:44 PM
He nods.  "Talk to your companions and your lawyer and come back at your first convenience.  Also do not lose that thing."
He thanks you and his guards escort you out.
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/14/2025 9:51 PM
I also want to do a little digging before I sign, can @Demented Avenger (Ioannes) do research on rarities, "Lost and Found" and wicktrimmer?  Can I use merchant and streetwise to look into both for any information those skills might reveal?  Can Vallium ask around in his usual haunts? 

Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/14/2025 9:57 PM
Vael would like to ask around using the people and skills he used to develop streetwise and merchant, as well as his usual friends like Creon about Wicktrimmer, Lost and Found and the Rarities factor, their reputation, their capabilites, their trustworthiness and so on.

Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 9/15/2025 11:39 AM
Ioannes will do Research on Lost and Found and the Rarities Factor
dripton (GM) — 9/15/2025 11:52 AM
You find that Lost and Found had some unbelievable exploits that were probably made up.  This Balthazar guy seemed to have been big on self-promotion.  The Rarities Factor appears to be a banking factor in Gosterwick and Newmarket, but the story that Wicktrimmer is the owner seems doubtful.  There's probably a rich noble behind the scenes, but you don't find who.

You really should link to the vote when you say that, but also you’re the loot czar — people have expressly given you license to make the call.
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/16/2025 7:35 AM
We previously said that certain major things would require a vote. Entering into what is intentionally structured as a long-term relationship with a NPC Patron feels pretty major to me. 
And it's only partially within my purview given the powers entrusted to me by the party

Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/16/2025 1:13 PM
Provided this feedback from grudge brigade is included I'll bring the contract and the knife to to wick trimmer and execute the contract. 
@Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) I think first refusal probably needs a few more outs — you want to be able to trade items for items with whoever (to obtain things money can’t buy), and probably be able to sell to any adventuring companions or mercenaries (you’ve met quite a few adventurers that might join you on occasion)
I will bring @Demented Avenger (Ioannes) and @Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) with me to sign contract as three representatives of R4R
dripton (GM) — 9/16/2025 1:21 PM
You surrender Larel's Pin to Wicktrimmer.  He asks for any other Larel stuff you're willing to part with.
He also asks if you're willing to write something to explain the circumstances where you found Larel's Pin, to help with provenance.  "You don't have to put any secrets in there, just whatever you feel is relevant but won't hurt your interests."
"I probably won't show any of this to anyone but my friend Balthazar in the near term, but if ten years from now I decide to sell this to some rich noble, it would be nice to help authenticate it."
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/16/2025 1:26 PM
I'm willing to write up something.  And I'll offer the non magical/aura items to him at retail rather than trying to squeeze him for more as a sign of friendship.
dripton (GM) — 9/16/2025 1:26 PM
He's happy to buy the love notes, non-magical cloaks, and the non-magical knife collection. 
Archon Shiva (Grudge Brigade) — 9/16/2025 1:26 PM
(You might not want to point this out, but we killed a Balthazar) 
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/16/2025 1:27 PM
(shhh)
Does he have any Intel on our enemies?
dripton (GM) — 9/16/2025 1:29 PM
He says "I don't know who killed your friend Susarra.  My usual sources didn't find anything unusual until after I heard she was dead.  So I suspect whoever did it was from out of town and not carrying any really impressive magic." 
"So either the Settites sent one of their own to do it, or they hired an out-of-town assassin."
"If I find out, I'll let you know."
"I haven't heard of any threats to your group, but I'd remain cautious."
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/16/2025 1:30 PM
I'll explain how we've got a body count of roughly 50 set cultists so far.
dripton (GM) — 9/16/2025 1:30 PM
"Yeah, I can see why that would piss them off."
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/16/2025 1:30 PM

No
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/16/2025 1:32 PM
"Who's that?  Someone I should know?"
dripton (GM) — 9/16/2025 1:33 PM
"Yes, he's the head of the Drome in Narsileon.  Do not mess with him."
"I imagine eradicating the Set cult in Arden Vul falls under his jurisdiction."
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/16/2025 1:33 PM
"Worth letting him know what we're up to?  would reaching out offend anyone here in Gosterwick?" 
dripton (GM) — 9/16/2025 1:35 PM
He grimaces.  "So, the politics between Lady Alexia and her idi^W half-brother mean the Imperial chain of command gets a bit confused sometimes.  I don't know if the Drome in Gosterwick actually talks to the Drome in Narsileon much.  So I'd keep it quiet."
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/16/2025 1:36 PM
"I may need to do some political research, sounds like there's some moving pieces I should be aware of if we're going to keep moving things around this much"
"Thanks for your time, anything you want me to keep in mind the next time I venture out?" 
dripton (GM) — 9/16/2025 1:38 PM
"Look out for assassins.  I'm surprised they sent anyone to Gosterwick; the last thing they should want to do is piss off The Green Lady and the Azure Knights.  But if you're in their turf, and they know who you are, they'll come after you."
"Don't sleep in Arden Vul.  Don't split up.  If you must, 2 guards and Mystic Mist."
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/16/2025 1:39 PM
"I think we're going to be switching gears for a while and just strafing their outer guard posts until we find a novel way to hurt them, anything you'd love to see us explore?"

"I haven't been in the Ruins in a few years. Other than the Obsidian Gates, and the green dragon's hoard, I don't know where the good stuff is."
"We never got past the Obsidian Gates and never thought it was worth messing with the dragon."
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/16/2025 1:41 PM
"That green dragon is risky business, you take a swing there, you best not miss."
"I've talked with him"
dripton (GM) — 9/16/2025 1:42 PM
"And then we found a big enough pile of solidi and magic items that my friend's girlfriend decided they should get married and he should stop risking his life, end of party." 
"Balthazaar now raises kids and makes potions in Narsileon.  Boring."
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/16/2025 1:43 PM
"How often does he make it out this way?"
dripton (GM) — 9/16/2025 1:43 PM
"Never.  I make it down there once in a while."
"It's a long trip so I mostly let Narsileon branch manage itself, but they need to know that the boss might drop in."
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/16/2025 1:44 PM

dripton (GM) — 9/16/2025 1:44 PM

"Not that there is any shortage of good mages in Narsileon, but he's the one I trust implicitly."

dripton (GM) — 9/16/2025 1:47 PM
He seems to really like the Larel stuff.
You think maybe you're talking to the magic item collector not the banker.
Wicktrimmer has his guards escort you out, and says "send over the list of what you're looking for and your max prices when convenient.  Here's a receipt showing $20k in your Right for Riches account, so that's your spending limit, or feel free to withdraw some."
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/16/2025 1:50 PM
(once I do some accounting after all the money I've spent, I may deposit some...)
(we'll see if the party partially reimburses me for it too)
dripton (GM) — 9/16/2025 1:51 PM
They are open for bank business (deposits, withdrawals, changing money, putting valuables in a vault) during normal bankers' hours.
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/16/2025 1:52 PM
So we can keep our party stash there in terms of items?
dripton (GM) — 9/16/2025 1:52 PM
You can keep whatever you want there, as long as it's not huge.
You should track somewhere what's on your PCs, what's in your rooms, what's at the Rarities Factor, and what's in the dam.  (I think that's all the places.)
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/16/2025 1:54 PM
it is for now.
Archon Shiva (Grudge Brigade) — 9/16/2025 1:54 PM
I suggest making Equipment Containers in Other Equipment, one for each category.  But also the sreadsheet can be used.
dripton (GM) — 9/16/2025 1:55 PM
It's fine to say something like "I keep $500 of my money on me and the rest in the vault" rather than constantly tracking all the categories.
Oh I think some of you might have accounts at one of the other factors, but Rarities is free now, if you prefer.
OTOH if you'd rather pay to split up where your loot is, that's fine.
dripton (GM) — 9/16/2025 2:04 PM
With Larel's Pin sold for $20k I assume everyone gets 2 XP for loot this week, so I updated the XP sheet.

The feedback I wanted to incorporate: ⁠ooc-planning⁠
@Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) I think first refusal probably needs a few more outs — you want to be able to trade items for items with whoever (to obtain things money can’t buy), and probably be able to sell to any adventuring companions or mercenaries (you’ve met quite a few adventurers that might join you on occasion)
The place where I mentioned including it: 
⁠Lawyer discussion⁠
I'd like to get his wording, and to incorporate the grudge brigade feedback.  A local incorporation should be fine for now. I can pay 750 if he can rush it

The words I want to add:
after "give items that seem otherwise worthwhile to certain important figures"
add " additionally, to barter for unique goods or services, or pay adventuring companions in-kind." 
I'll also change the last give and given to give or trade, and given or traded just to keep it all consistient.
Changes made.

Draft of Statement for Wicktrimmer.  Feedback desired @Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon)  @Demented Avenger (Ioannes) , Vael is trying to play into Wicktrimmer's desire to believe here, I'm also trying to draw attention away from the things we're keeping:
On the Provenance of the Larel Artifacts

An Account of the Discovery within the Thothian Necropolis, by Vael Sunshadow

It is a rare privilege to uncover a secret that history has forgotten, and a rarer one still to prove a legend true. Such was our fortune in the deep and silent precincts of the Thothian halls.

Our explorations led us to a series of forgotten ceremonial chambers, far from the notice of other delvers. We found ourselves in what appeared to be a minor funereal complex.  The antechambers were as expected for a minor Thothian complex, but one sealed door led not to a simple crypt, but to the true prize: the final resting place of a figure many believed to be a myth. There could be no doubt; the walls were dominated by frescos of Larel himself, depicted in his iconic green cap and with his famous dagger. The surrounding walls brought his tales to life in painted scenes: Larel distracting wolves with a chicken, concealing himself from an angry husband, and cleverly spiking apples on his dagger while performing a card trick.

Rather than being interred in a sarcophagus as is common among Thothians, the hero's effects were laid outon racks in the chamber, as if waiting for his return. A small rack held a collection of fine, wicked-looking daggers, many with magical auras. Upon a writing desk lay a golden apple next to a simple silver 'letter opener'—which we immediately recognized as Larel's legendary pin—alongside three identical love notes to differently named women. In the center of the room, a capped urn rested upon a stone pedestal, containing what can only be the hero's ashes.
