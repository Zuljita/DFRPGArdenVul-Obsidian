Michael, Uvash, and Vallium are enjoying breakfast in the main common room of the Yellow Cloak Inn when they hear a woman scream from the adjoining dormitory building.  A couple of minutes later, Margot the Red comes into the common room, along with one of the Thesmothete's guards.  She walks over to their table and says "Master Vallium, sorry to interrupt your meal, but the groom told me your horse is having some distress with one of his feet, and ye might want to have a look, decide whether to call in Sakeon or a druid."  She motions toward the door.  Vallium does not actually have a warhorse in the stable, so this is suspicious, but he follows Margot.  Once out of earshot of the other guests, the guard says "It looks like something bad happened to someone, and Margot says she thinks you knew her.   Can you take a look?"  Margot and the guard lead you to a first-floor room, with another guard standing outside the door.  They open the door, and inside is a headless female corpse, and a lot of blood.  Even without the head, you are sure it's Susarra, based on her build and the device on the round wooden shield propped up in the corner.  (You do not see Susarra's head, axe, ring, mail, or backpack, though.)  The guard asks Vallium if he knows of any enemies Susarra had, or who might do such a thing to her.

Vallium will relay to the guard that she had recently been involved in killing a number of Settites in the ruins of Arden Vul.  He asks if this is something that should go through the House if Sight.
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 8/31/2025 12:58 PM
Once I'm formed, I'm going to want to try to use seeker for her head... I'm going to collect blood samples
informed
dripton (GM) — 8/31/2025 12:58 PM
The guard says "Of course, the Drome shall be informed, as shall Lady Alexia.  Murder is not tolerated in Gosterwick."
Archon Shiva (Grudge Brigade) — 8/31/2025 12:58 PM
If you get the head you can have her raised, right?
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 8/31/2025 12:58 PM
Ioannes is going to check to see if she was dead before she lost her head
Cosmo (Uvash)

 — 8/31/2025 12:58 PM
Uvash is going to look for any signs of struggle.
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 8/31/2025 12:59 PM
Possibly, but I don't think we're going to throw that much money at it.   I'm mostly interested in tracking the perpetrator.
They have a gauche habit of hanging trophies like that on their walls
Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 8/31/2025 1:01 PM
"Would the Drome be interested in statements from those who were with her in the days leading up to her death?"
dripton (GM) — 8/31/2025 1:02 PM
The lead guard says "Yes, please give me their names and locations, and we will ask them to confirm your identification of the body.  Normally one identification suffices but without the head..."
Ioannes and Uvash both notice a lot of cuts in the bed, as though someone took several tries to remove the head.
Cosmo (Uvash)

 — 8/31/2025 1:06 PM
"Huh, they are clearly not skilled." Uvash says. What is the size of the cuts? The amount of impact? (light, heavy, etc)
dripton (GM) — 8/31/2025 1:13 PM
The guard does not agree to let Vael take blood samples.  Later that day, a messenger drops by the Arcane Practitioners Club and gives Vael a small package.  Vael Apportates the package to the alchemy lab, asks Ioannes to wait outside in case something bad happens when he opens it, and then Apportates the package open.  Inside is a small flask of blood and a note that says "Your request for a sample of the victim's blood has been approved  -- Audun Yellow-Eyes, logothete, House of Sight." 
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 8/31/2025 1:13 PM
(I have a little availability for the next hour and then probably none for another 2 hours or so) 
dripton (GM) — 8/31/2025 1:14 PM
Uvash thinks it probably took several blows with a large sharp axe.  It left dents in the bed.
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 8/31/2025 1:14 PM
(out of character she was a tough gal)
All right with the blood sample. Am I able to run a seeker/Trace
Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 8/31/2025 1:19 PM
(Worth noting that while everyone knows that Vallium is part of R4R, no Settite who looked upon Vallium's actual face survived.  Also true for any of the previous sessions.  Vallium does not volunteer that he was present during the recent events.)
dripton (GM) — 8/31/2025 1:20 PM
Noted.  Vallium did walk into the Yellow Cloak with Susarra (Vallium already a guest there, Susarra looking for a place to stay in Gosterwick) which is probably why Margot connected them.
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 8/31/2025 1:20 PM
We've seen spy holes and heard people running away that we didn't see.
dripton (GM) — 8/31/2025 1:21 PM
Seeker: Susarra's head about 10 miles north.
Trace: Susarra's head about 10 miles north, currently not moving.
You can maintain the Trace as long as you stay awake, but eventually you have to sleep and lose it.
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 8/31/2025 1:21 PM
In the past when I've run seeker I get a little vision around it, not this time?
I'll give up on spending points this week to get right back out there and hunt it down before I sleep
dripton (GM) — 8/31/2025 1:22 PM
If the group agrees to leave 3 days early and not do any downtime activities, then you can still have Trace on when we start the next session.
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 8/31/2025 1:22 PM
10 miles north is basically Arden vul right?
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 8/31/2025 1:24 PM
Does that include learning skills?
dripton (GM) — 8/31/2025 1:25 PM
The head is in a well-decorated room.  There is a coffee table, some matching chairs, some ewers of some kind of drink, a writing desk, etc.  The head is in a backpack in the corner.
dripton (GM) — 8/31/2025 1:25 PM
If you rush back to the dungeon, no skills that require training.  Any skills that I think you used enough recently to have actually learned in play are fair game though.
Archon Shiva (Grudge Brigade) — 8/31/2025 1:26 PM
If non- @Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) players haven’t seen it, there’s a thread in ⁠grudge-brigade that may be relevant.


Archon Shiva (Grudge Brigade) — 8/31/2025 10:53 AM
🪙
 Coinbase approaches Vael @Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) with an offer.

He has information relevant to R4R that he would rather sell than act on.  The « suggested value » of the information is $15k.

He would sell it to Vael (or R4R) for $2,500, plus a tip to be determined by the buyer after measuring its impact, which would inform the Brigade’s future handling of any similar opportunities.
He indicates that he would also take the whip as payment.
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 8/31/2025 10:59 AM
I'm down for that.  I'll take the risk personally rather than expose the company to it at this time and may come back to them for reimbursement or additional funds for the "tip" if we determine the information is actually 1) actionable and 2) valuable.
And by "take the risk personally" I think I mean "buy the whip out of the party loot and give it to you" I think.
Need to double check the math
Archon Shiva (Grudge Brigade) — 8/31/2025 11:18 AM
Tell me when you’re ready for the info dump.
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 8/31/2025 11:20 AM
I'll pay somehow, feel free to hit me whenever.
Archon Shiva (Grudge Brigade) — 8/31/2025 11:59 AM
Coinbase hands you a letter, saying it was received at the Grudge Brigade HQ.

It offers the $2500 each to capture or kill Vael, Ioannes, Michael, Uvash, Vallium, and Susarra.

« Bring them or their remains to the Forum in Arden Vul.  Carry the letter as a pass.  Show it to the Duty Deacon in the Forum, who will alert the Pontifex. » 
Be on the lookout for other groups taking the job.  You may also use the letter as part of a plot to infiltrate the Forum.
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 8/31/2025 1:29 PM
@everyone tagging you for visibility
dripton (GM) — 8/31/2025 1:30 PM
Confirming that Vallium's name really was on the note, despite the care Vallium took to disguise his appearance during the attack on the temple and not tell anyone he was there.
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 8/31/2025 4:44 PM
I didn't see anything from coinbase indicating that he would rather I not share this invitation... Was that an intended undertone?
Archon Shiva (Grudge Brigade) — 8/31/2025 4:55 PM
No.  He sold you the letter.  You do as you please.

I posted it here so the players could see it (and mentioned it in general), but it’s Vael’s call whether he shows it to others.

You can wait until after your operation to decide on the tip, if any.
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/13/2025 2:47 PM
I'll personally tip.
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/13/2025 3:25 PM
Overall, I think we can pay you 3k for the information, it didn't save Suzara and we found the same hiring agent anyway, but it corroborated some things.  and we want you to bring us more of that in future.  I think it was also in GB's interest to bring us this as (I suspect) we're some of the best customers.
