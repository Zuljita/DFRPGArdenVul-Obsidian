How many minor healing potions are available in Gosterwick this week?

And Freydis the Stern gives you a suspicious look like "didn't you ask that last week?  How often are you getting hurt?"

Ioannes will buy all available again, then do research on Ptarmis and brew a Greater Healing Potion

Ptarmis was a famous Thothian priest from long ago, back in the early days of Arden Vul, who discovered the Great Cavern and brought it under Archontean control.  He apparently also bred giant mushrooms.  One source said he left his family and church behind to live with his mushrooms, like some kind of weird Druid.
