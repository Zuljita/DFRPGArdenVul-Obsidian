This is about the Yellow Cloak Inn, where most of the party (other than Vael and Ioannes) are staying.
Main structure is a 5 story building near the Central Market.  There is a 3 story addition.  There is a reception area, a lounge, an upper-class common room, a main common room, a bunch of individual guest rooms for rent (max occupancy 3), and a couple of dormitories full of bunkbeds.  There are stables in the back.  Meals are served in both common rooms; the upper class room has better food but is more expensive.  Your $150/week cost of living pays for a room and 3 meals per day.  (With most meals in the main common room but a couple per week in the upper-class room if you want.) The innkeeper is Margot the Red, a Thorcin woman.  Her husband Bricwine is the upper-class bartender.  Helle, a Wiskin woman, tends bar in the main common room.
They do not like people casting spells in the Inn, especially if they critically fail.
