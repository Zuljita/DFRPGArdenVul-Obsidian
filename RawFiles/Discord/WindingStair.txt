Walking up the cliff face takes about 90 minutes, depending on caution and encumbrance;
Levitating takes about 10 minutes, and flight should get there in 3 minutes. (edited)Wednesday, April 9, 2025 2:31 PM
There is a cave with a fire pit about halfway up, and another over the next switchback with spider webs.
The cliff is 1500' high, or 500 hexes.
