Research: You read an account from about 50 years ago.  A group of the late Lord Burdock's men-at-arms climbed the cliff face to explore the ruins of Arden Vul, met a huge green dragon, and 10 out of the 12 men, including three knights, died.  (The only survivors were two young men who were kept back to hold horses, and they lost most of the horses and baggage as they fled.)  Lord Burdock then forbade any more of his subjects from going up the Long Stair to the ruins, lest they anger the dragon further.  He also discouraged outsiders from using the Burdock Valley as a base for exploration of the ruins.  So there was apparently very little exploration of the ruins until his death 25 years ago.
