If Vael takes Ioannes with him to the Temple of Demma, and lets Ioannes do the talking, he can get it cast at book rate.  If he goes alone, he has to pay the heathen unbeliever rate. (edited)Saturday, March 22, 2025 2:33 PM

(If one of your clerics actually learns Remove Curse, that's another option.)

I did the loot sheet for session 2.  The cursed torch has been Remove Cursed and then placed in the wheelbarrow with a Do Not Touch sign; let me know if you want to get it identified, sell it as is, or keep it (without touching it).

I think I've already processed the loot.  As far as the torch is concerned, I doubt we make more selling it than it's worth. My reflex is to hold on to it just in case we find a good way to make use of it but otherwise leave it in a corner and only handle it with tongs

@Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) You did process it; I missed the second tab.  But I think you missed the scroll of See Secrets that I added later.

So you either have a little more money, or a scroll to keep.

I've got a thread going for this week's loot management.  I get that a number of players are less engaged and I'm not mad about it... I do wonder if any of ya'll would trust another player with a proxy vote so we can sort out the questions faster.  Don't have to make the call now, just trying to figure out how we can make it clear to people where we stand as early in the week as possible so points can be spent and so on.

As a person without much of a stake, I propose the following: 
Kyle, who seems engaged with this, has tons of experience both on the GM side of DFRPG treasure management and as a player for three years on a Dripton mega campaign.

Let’s give him proxy power regarding loot, to determine what requires consultation and how long he waits for answers before making the decision.  This power can be rescinded at any time by any TWO players asking Dripton (public or in private).

Okay, based on those two thumbs up, I'm going to take Kyle's decisions as binding for the group on minor stuff like "we spend $100 of party funds to get this item identified" and "we sell this pile of relatively unexciting stuff to generate loot to get more XP."  Kyle should still go back to the group for input on major decisions, like "would we rather keep this awesome item or get another XP?" and "How do we decide who gets the Item of Everyonewantsit?"

I'm inclined to keep but not pay to ID the torch because I don't think it'll add much value to the horde (break even at best) and one day I'll be able to ID it for free.  At that time, we may be able to find other interesting uses for it.

I'm also inclined to keep the scroll as selling it won't get us more CP and buying one on purpose would be difficult.  I'll advocate for selling this item for more later once we're making more money if we have enough clerics who know the spell.

I concur.  Plus, it seems like light is very important to Thoth, so there may be more than expected uses for it in some locations.

Overall, we only made a little over the minimum to keep the company in food and lodging for a week.  Not a great session from a loot perspective.

(I'm not sure I'll be able to keep up with quartermaster every week, so if anyone's interested in how I handle it, I'm happy to share knowledge.  It'd also be useful to have another eye on the math that the spreadsheet does... happy to teach formulas which are a handy job skill if you don't already have it... except AI does it credibly well) (edited)Sunday, March 23, 2025 11:14 PM
