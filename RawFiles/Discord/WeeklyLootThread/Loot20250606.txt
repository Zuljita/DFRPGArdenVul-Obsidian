Loot 2025-06-06
dripton (GM) — 6/7/2025 10:09 AM
I updated the loot spreadsheet.  Bunch of unidentified stuff since you don't have Vael around to ID things.  @Demented Avenger (Ioannes) I assume you'll pay to ID anything that looks magical?  What about non-magical weapons; ID to find out if they are quality, or just sell?
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 6/7/2025 10:10 AM
ID as much as I can 
dripton (GM) — 6/7/2025 10:26 AM
You spend a bunch of cash at the Arcane Practitioners Club, Torunn the smith, and Chairduster the jeweler getting everything identified.
The magic pebble disappears from the APC and shows up back in Chrysalis's pocket!  After another try it is identified as a returning pebble, a pebble that returns to its owner after about 30 minutes.  It's hard to put a value on an item you can't sell; looks like it's part of her share unless you figure out a way. 
The ghost's circlet is platinum and valuable.
The shield you found on the bottom of the grotto is cursed and just about worthless; luckily it didn't stick to anyone's arm so you don't need to Remove Curse it.  You can throw it away, or give it to someone you hate.
The red glass square is another of those teleportation keys.
One shortsword is normal.  Another is fine and balanced and Pelteon initially gets very excited and says "OMG it's a Luck Blade, these things have Wishes!  But then says "sadly, it has no wishes left.  And, no, I didn't just use the last one.  But still helps you resist spells."
The magic greatsword Oculus is quite valuable except it turns out its owner is well known so it's probably hard to sell legally in Gosterwick without some process. 
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 6/7/2025 10:31 AM
"I didn't use it either, Pelteon, since I'd wish for you."
dripton (GM) — 6/7/2025 10:33 AM
Pelteon seems to ignore Ioannes slightly less since he appears to be well on his way to Very Wealthy, and also has very impressive cat.
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 6/7/2025 10:33 AM
"Or better yet, just give you the wish."
dripton (GM) — 6/7/2025 10:34 AM
The knight's scale armor is fine and magical and less traceable than his sword, so worth a lot.
The small pink gems aren't worth much more than the cost to ID them, but they're pretty.
Finally the 12 Labors of Arden book is a nice edition, but it's a common book so it's not worth a lot.
All on the loot sheet; Ioannes can figure out what to sell to give the mercs their 2/3, and what to keep.
Pelteon thinks hard about what she'd do with a wish.  She wizardsplains that there are actually 3 kinds of wishes and the kind in the fairy tales are Greater Wishes and are actually very rare, so the blade probably only had Lesser Wishes which are still useful but can't be used to make you beautiful or give you a castle and servants.
She drops like 16 different Mithric words into the explanation.
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 6/7/2025 10:39 AM
"But you're already beautiful, Pelteon. So that's one wish you don't need."
dripton (GM) — 6/7/2025 10:42 AM
Pelteon saw that one coming a mile away and was not impressed.
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 6/7/2025 10:43 AM
This character hits like Ron Herbel
Archon Shiva (Grudge Brigade) — 6/7/2025 10:44 AM
Pick-up artist negging version: “Way to waste a wish on lowering your appearance…”
The pebbles pouch is Chrysalis’, not The GOAT (which is an acronym, so all caps).
dripton (GM) — 6/7/2025 10:46 AM
Okay, she's the one with the returning pebble she can't get rid of.
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 6/7/2025 10:48 AM
I manually overrode the total number of share on Kyle's sheet to 3 to get it right this week, Chrysalis and GOAT
so you get two of them
Archon Shiva (Grudge Brigade) — 6/7/2025 10:56 AM
Not that it’s going to matter much in this big a loot, but Chrysalis takes $900 less as the staff is part of her payment.

I think the party should keep the sword, even if just as a backup weapon; it feels too good to sell.  ST 20 +2 Striking +2 Mantis Strike even allows one-handed use (and you might get a ST +2 item by then to save the Monk access)

The mercs would take the armor at 40% value as part of their share and settle details internally.  Chrysalis seems like the most likely user.
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 6/7/2025 10:56 AM
We could keep this flight potion. The big haul is the armor
We really can't sell the sword, but we have to sell the armor
Archon Shiva (Grudge Brigade) — 6/7/2025 10:57 AM
My understanding is that if the armor goes to mercs and you guys keep the sword, none of these count towards cp.  I’d sell the potion, you have many options for flight.
Lemme get to computer for math.
Can I mess with the sheet?
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 6/7/2025 11:04 AM
fiddle around
Archon Shiva (Grudge Brigade) — 6/7/2025 11:50 AM
I had to mostly bypass Kyle's sheet as it either wasn't set up for this situation or I did failed to understand his intent in a quick gloss.  I made a new sheet marked with my name that I think is correct, netting Ioannes $1510.33 without selling either of the two big ticket items.

Because Ioannes was the party, the sword actually belongs to him personally, as there is no way to differentiate his share from the party's share.  He can sell or trade it freely to someone else who can use it better, for whatever price he likes, knowing he would get a cool $7k for it whenever Coinbase or Lacrymosa is around.

Chrysalis owes The GOAT a lot of money, but they'll settle that amongst themselves, it doesn't affect you.
Feel free to check my math, find  a way to fit it on the other sheet or delete the other sheet, or hide my sheet.  Take this as the mercenaries' splitting proposal. 
Most numbers are hidden upper right.
dripton (GM) — 6/7/2025 11:51 AM
$1510 isn't enough for 2 CP anymore.  Ioannes needs a couple hundred more.
Archon Shiva (Grudge Brigade) — 6/7/2025 11:51 AM
Oh.  How much?
The sheet still has only one threshold.
dripton (GM) — 6/7/2025 11:52 AM
He was 167 CP at the start, so he needs 1670 net after any expenses.  Consider stuff like rations and power item use.
Archon Shiva (Grudge Brigade) — 6/7/2025 11:56 AM
I forgot the pebble.  Let's say Chrysalis treats it as a $500 value (It's not a $15k Loyal Weapon for sure but must be worth at least $1250), that'll push Ioannes to $1677. 
It's valuable, just not sellable.
dripton (GM) — 6/7/2025 11:57 AM
Okay, if she sees value in it.  This is the kind of item that some would consider valuable and others would consider cursed.
Depending largely on one's affinity for pebbles.
Archon Shiva (Grudge Brigade) — 6/7/2025 11:57 AM
She has throwing art.  It's valuable.
Also going to try using it delayed fuse.
@Demented Avenger (Ioannes) Thoughts on this distribution?
Archon Shiva (Grudge Brigade) — 6/7/2025 12:07 PM
I also made sure to keep the cursed shield so we can give it to the halflings.
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 6/7/2025 1:56 PM
If keeping the shield counts towards getting 2 CP I’m fine with it. I care more about hitting IQ 13 next session than a super-sweet sword, however
Archon Shiva (Grudge Brigade) — 6/7/2025 1:57 PM
It doesn't count towards it, it counts against it, but you do get 2 cp for loot, 3 cp total.
I did miscount it a bit, but you're still at $1671.66 in physical coin (after If fixed the math);  That's with you personally owning the sword, the cursed shield, and the red glass square.
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 6/7/2025 2:02 PM
Alright then
dripton (GM) — 6/7/2025 2:07 PM
Ioannes charging the rest of the party for his personal red square every time they want to use it to teleport.
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 6/7/2025 2:07 PM
We have to figure out how to use it first
dripton (GM) — 6/7/2025 2:08 PM
It's more a business plan than a running business.
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 6/7/2025 2:09 PM
Charge the party members? Never. Charge the halflings? Hmmm
If lucrative enough, Ioannes would argue for keeping them alive
“You can’t kill Roskelly! He’s good for a gold every week!”
Archon Shiva (Grudge Brigade) — 6/7/2025 2:24 PM
A client nation?  Charge them a percentage of their take, but back them up if someone is resisting.
Archon Shiva (Grudge Brigade) — 6/7/2025 3:59 PM
@dripton (GM) What's Oculus' value as a power item?
dripton (GM) — 6/7/2025 4:08 PM
$7200
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 6/7/2025 6:45 PM
So what is Ioannes's take-home wealth now, @Archon Shiva (Grudge Brigade)
Archon Shiva (Grudge Brigade) — 6/7/2025 6:48 PM
He gets a sword, a glass cube, a cursed shield, replenishes his potions and power item, and gets $1671.66.
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 6/7/2025 6:49 PM
Gosh, pennies!
dripton (GM) — 6/7/2025 6:56 PM
There are no pennies in Arden Vul.
Coppers are $0.1
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 6/7/2025 6:57 PM
Who gets the coppers?
dripton (GM) — 6/7/2025 6:57 PM
Sounds like you guys need to learn rock-paper-scissors.
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 6/7/2025 7:09 PM
He also needs $16 for expenses (rations and power item use), @Archon Shiva (Grudge Brigade), so needs $1,670+$16 if I'm understanding things right 
Archon Shiva (Grudge Brigade) — 6/7/2025 7:31 PM
Deducted in N2
You actually got $1687.66, $16 of which you used to replenish your rations and power item.
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 6/7/2025 7:32 PM
ok, got it
what do we do about the fraction?
dripton (GM) — 6/7/2025 7:33 PM
Moneychangers keep fractions.
Archon Shiva (Grudge Brigade) — 6/7/2025 7:33 PM
The GOAT pocketed whatever was tinier than the smallest coin available.
Or that.
At any rate, it's gone.
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 6/7/2025 7:33 PM
fine by me
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 6/8/2025 6:48 AM
I'll try to see what didn't work with my sheet sometime soon but I'm about to be traveling again for a good 3 weeks including a cruise, so who knows
Archon Shiva (Grudge Brigade) — 6/8/2025 8:20 AM
Part of it was it wasn’t made for what I asked of it.  I can get useful numbers from mine until you’re back.
