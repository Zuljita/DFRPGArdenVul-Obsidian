"It appears this is a Gem of Making Wizards Fight About Who Gets It.  Just kidding.  It's a Gem of Insight.  Basically a permanent Wisdom spell, but you have to continually hold onto the gem for a long period of time, on the order of 3 months, for it to take effect.  There may be some variability on that time period.  Also, the sources say that once it works it might become merely a very valuable diamond, or it might work again after 50 years or so.  So if the user is sure it's worked and the effect is permanent, they can sell it to a rich elf or a rich noble who cares about their grandchildren.  You might be able to mount it in something to avoid having to hold it in your hand for months, but what jeweller can you trust with it?"

Dripton: "I'll give you a 40% share in the Arcane Practitioner's Club for it."
"I don't have enough liquid wealth to make a cash offer.  If you want to sell it, I'll talk to the Green Lady for you.  She's loaded."
"And she would want it." 
Zuljita:"Talk to me about what the current ownership structure looks like?  What's the business prospects for the club?  You need to sell me on what you're offering.  Further, what would you ask if you were going to try to sell it to the green lady?"
(I'll roll merchant to evaluate it myself given what I know about the item) 
Dripton: You think it's worth $5000 as a diamond, ignoring the magic. 
Zuljita IMO, the adventuring company would own that stake, so it'd have to provide ongoing benefits enough to override 20 cp worth of extra growth for one character in 3 months.
I've got no idea what to ask the green lady if I were going to try to sell it? 
Dripton: Lyssandra said "I'd ask for $25k and the title of Warden of Vetucaster for everyone in your group.  Seriously, having the Green Lady on your side would be really valuable.  You should consider it.  Or you could keep it and get smarter, which is what I'd do, but Lady Alexia already likes me." 
Zuljita:Do I have any sense for what "warden of vetucaster" is/means? 
"What would that title grant us?" 
@Demented Avenger (Ioannes) @Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) @Adam M @Archon Shiva (Grudge Brigade) We'll all probably want to give input on this discussion
dripton (GM) — 4/5/2025 10:24 AM
Lyssandra says "it's a minor noble title here in town.  It's good for a discount on land.  Also, the Green Lady pays Wardens a bounty for every prosperous merchant or craftsman they attract to her town.  Basically, she sells noble titles to convince people to move here.  It works -- she's taken this town from 200 mostly poor people to 2000 mostly-not people in 20 years.  Also, Wardens can get audiences with the Green Lady, to give input into town matters.  Still her town though, she makes final decisions of import, delegates the grunt work to the Thesmothete."
"If you don't care about all that, it's a way to get the ruling noble of Gosterwick on your side."
"You haven't met her yet right?  She usually grants an audience to adventurers of note, but I don't think you guys are that famous yet.  You are pretty good at finding treasure though, I'll give you that."
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 4/5/2025 10:27 AM
"It's a gift.  Okay talk to me about what we'd get out of a 40% stake in your business." 
dripton (GM) — 4/5/2025 10:31 AM
"I expect you'll want to see our books, but we actually, um, deliberately don't keep very good records for, um, reasons.  The Collegium have a legal monopoly on magic in the Empire and we're kind of skirting it, because they're not in Gosterwick yet.  But the Green Lady is okay with us having a Club here to train wizards and identify items, so it's a don't-ask-too-many-questions situation."
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 4/5/2025 10:32 AM
I'd need to have a really strong understanding of what  you are offering in return before I could propose this to the company
It sounds like there's a significant business risk around the rest of the empire growing too big here...
dripton (GM) — 4/5/2025 10:32 AM
"Anyway, we pull in thousands a month in training and identification and membership fees, but we put a lot of that back into the business stocking the library and buying scrolls and stuff.   Currently we each only take out living expenses.  But if you gave us the gem we'd be able to give you a dividend of something like a thousand a month, as long as we're in business."
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 4/5/2025 10:33 AM
(in meta terms, does this mean we get a supplement to XP or this is not count towards treasure?)
dripton (GM) — 4/5/2025 10:33 AM
It's not treasure
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 4/5/2025 10:33 AM
Makes sense. I don't think that the money is the primary driver here.
dripton (GM) — 4/5/2025 10:33 AM
"To be honest with you, I would turn around and sell it to Lady Alexia, because if I kept it for myself, Pelteon would probably leave."
"So my recommendation would be to either use it or sell it to the Green Lady."
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 4/5/2025 10:36 AM
Selling it gives us 25k which lets us keep everything else, get two XP each and have a few items that are probably owned by the party that could be used by whoever it makes for most sense to give them to per session
dripton (GM) — 4/5/2025 10:36 AM
And the thanks of the person who owns this town.
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 4/5/2025 10:37 AM
Keeping it gives one character a 20 XP boost in a few months, but if they die we lose that for good.
dripton (GM) — 4/5/2025 10:38 AM
Oh, she adds one note to the identification: "to keep the full +1 you have to keep it on you forever.  If you lose or sell it after long enough for the +1 to stick, you keep the IQ! but lose the Will and Per."
(She says that in flavor language.)
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 4/5/2025 10:38 AM
If we keep it to use, it doesn't grant any loot XP?  I recognize that once successfully used it is XP.
dripton (GM) — 4/5/2025 10:39 AM
No, it doesn't grant any loot XP if kept precisely because it's a big pile of inherent XP if kept.
(Eventually.)
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 4/5/2025 10:39 AM
Yep, just making sure I say everything out loud so that everyone else can follow the logic
dripton (GM) — 4/5/2025 10:39 AM
If sold, it's worth enough to guarantee a 2 XP loot session for everyone without selling anything else.
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 4/5/2025 10:41 AM
We have three characters who would use it I think and there's no way to split it fairly
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 4/5/2025 11:01 AM
✨
 to buy some of the club 👑
 for the green lady 🧙‍♂️
 to keep it. @here
Archon Shiva (Grudge Brigade) — 4/5/2025 11:06 AM
Looking at this in the context of our DFW experience, I think [15] (+1 IQ) (or possibly [5], +1 IQ!) and an early $5k power item, when diluted against hundreds of cp over a few years, isn’t as valuable as the other options.  (You’re getting ~[5], 1 cp per PC, either way as a party through loot xp) 
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 4/5/2025 11:06 AM
I think you need to spell out what you think the 15 or 5 are
Archon Shiva (Grudge Brigade) — 4/5/2025 11:08 AM
Clearer?
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 4/5/2025 11:09 AM
Yes. Thank you
Archon Shiva (Grudge Brigade) — 4/5/2025 11:10 AM
Still by the DFW yardstick, limited access to magic items was our main restriction, with restricted ability access in second place (aka “qualifying as a swashbuckler”).  I would really look at the party’s ability to knock on that door.
The ratio of money-to-purchasables, in DFW, was such that the wizard ended up at [500]+ with a luxury townhouse, fully stocked alchemical shop, and a $120k mundane power item — and an $8k wand as her only “special purchase”.  There was nothing to spend it on.
The Club stake feels like it might give use additional access to scrolls, but not in a way that plain money wouldn’t.  Once rich enough, paying her some monthly retainer to set purchased scrolls aside for first refusal should be reasonably easy.
Archon Shiva (Grudge Brigade) — 4/5/2025 11:18 AM
“Attracting merchants” sounds like exactly what we want to do to open up shopping.  To my eyes, it looks like the key item to opening up a town growth mini-game — which BTW I’m willing to manage if there is such a thing.
$1k per month is $250 per delve, split 5 ways, with no xp attached.
In-universe, a stake in a club that will get wiped out once this town gets big enough to attract the Collegium isn’t the most attractive.
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 4/5/2025 11:22 AM
The only thing pushing the other direction is if we can use that stake to drive towards getting enchanters in town.
But I suspect we can do it the other way
Archon Shiva (Grudge Brigade) — 4/5/2025 11:23 AM
If not for the threat of the Collegium, I’d agree.  But I think she’s being pretty clear that any enchanters would attract the Collegium.
Lady Alexia makes decisions of import, and we do care about imports!
That’s a joke
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 4/5/2025 11:26 AM
Politics aside we sure do
Eventually we'll want to have things to buy that are cooler than what's currently available.
Archon Shiva (Grudge Brigade) — 4/5/2025 11:38 AM
Lyssandra’s comments also suggest that the town is nearing capacity in terms of their buying power.  You’ll lose out if you eventually can’t unload treasure because the market is too small.
I’m abstaining from the actual vote, as usual.
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 4/5/2025 12:57 PM
That sounds like a good argument to me. We are hitting the issues of item availability and fairly early
John-boy already has over 2k in loot to spend even before this delve
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 4/5/2025 3:10 PM
@here please use the poll to vote so I can stop worrying about things
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 4/5/2025 3:12 PM
I don’t quite get the options
Green lady?
dripton (GM) — 4/5/2025 3:14 PM
Sell the gem to the ruler of Gosterwick for a lump sum of cash and maybe political favor, sell the gem to the Arcane Practitioners Club for a stream of income, or keep the gem and maybe someone gets +1 IQ after a while.
Sell for lump sum -> enough cash that everyone gets 2 XP this session even if you keep other items
Other options: either 1 XP, or see if selling everything else gets enough.

Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 4/5/2025 10:23 AM
I'll pay to ID the glass square as well.
Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 4/5/2025 10:28 AM
This might be an item that works in conjunction with an artefact/location specific to Arden Vul.  Something we hold onto until we find a square-shaped hole for it.
dripton (GM) — 4/5/2025 10:28 AM
Lyssandra summons Pelteon (still sulking because there's no way she can afford that Gem of Insight) to identify the glass square.  Pelteon says it's some kind of key to a teleportation device.  The teleport magic isn't inherent to the square; it needs to be placed in a larger teleport object.
She also notes that it looks fragile and recommends putting it somewhere safe until you can figure out what it goes into.
