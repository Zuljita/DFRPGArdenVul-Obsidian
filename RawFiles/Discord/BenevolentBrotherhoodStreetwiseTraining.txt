I'll go ahead and pick up StreetWise at one point. I'd like to try and use it to anonymize the sale but not to haggle.

Okay, you went down to the Baliff's Truncheon with one of your big friends Just In Case and got a contact to tell you where the Benevolent Brotherhood has their public facade, then you went in there and the secretary "Shirley" (clearly a fake name) had you drop a note with your contact info in a mailbox with a symbol and no name on it, and then a guy named "Petros" (maybe a fake name?) dropped by the APC and offered to take you on a little tour of the less savory parts of the town and give you some pointers on how to sell stuff anonymously without getting robbed or ripped off.  You ended up getting the usual 40% for the Set armor from a guy by the docks who never got your real name.  Pay Petros your training costs.
After selling the Set armor, you all got 1 XP for loot, in addition to the 1 XP for exploration, for 2 XP total.
