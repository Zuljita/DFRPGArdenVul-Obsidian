Overview

The Temple of Demma in Gosterwick is a modest but well-maintained structure, standing as a place of healing, wisdom, and rural devotion in the shadow of a town that thrives on trade and adventurers. It is led by Chief Priest Vivian, a stern but fair Thorcin cleric, whose deep voice and unwavering gaze make him an imposing figure in religious circles. Though he trains new clerics in the mysteries of Demma, he is far from a mystic dreamer—he believes that faith must be practical, service-oriented, and rooted in daily life. Under his guidance, the temple prioritizes aid to the rural poor and farmers over the mercenary-driven economy of Gosterwick. The four assisting clerics manage daily rituals, bless fields and expectant mothers, and provide limited magical services, though these are first offered to true believers and those in genuine need.

Though Demma’s influence spans magic and mystery, the temple in Gosterwick is deeply tied to fertility, crops, and households. Its faithful include farmers, midwives, and homemakers, who bring offerings of seeds, bread, and woven charms to honor Demma’s blessings. The temple is guarded by six dedicated warriors, wielding flails in homage to the goddess, both as symbols of harvest and instruments of divine retribution. Unlike the more esoteric cults of Demma found in distant cities, this temple emphasizes practicality over theological debate—magic is meant to heal, strengthen, and preserve the cycles of life. However, the presence of scholars and traveling priests—especially those seeking lost magical knowledge—reminds everyone that Demma’s influence extends far beyond the fields and homes she protects. 
Mythology

Demma is the Great Nurturer, the goddess who sowed the first seeds of life and ensures the cycles of growth, harvest, and renewal continue unbroken. She is said to have woven the world’s fertility into the land itself, her touch bringing forth golden fields, strong children, and thriving households. Ancient myths tell of how she stole the secret of magic from the void and planted it within the soil and stars, granting mortals the ability to shape the world through wisdom and will. Though gentle in her blessings, Demma is unyielding in her wrath—when the selfish hoard, the corrupt abuse, or the wasteful defile her gifts, her flail strikes with famine, blight, and barrenness. Worshipers believe that to understand Demma’s will is to understand the balance of nature, hearth, and spirit, for in her, all things flourish—but only if tended with care. 
Theology

The theology of Demma centers on balance, stewardship, and the sacred duty of cultivation—whether of land, family, or knowledge. She teaches that fertility and abundance are gifts, but only to those who nurture them with wisdom and toil. To plant without care, hoard without sharing, or wield magic recklessly is to invite ruin, for just as she grants life, she can withdraw it, leaving only dust and barrenness. Her faithful are called to protect the cycles of nature, strengthen households, and guide new life into the world—be it through childbirth, farming, or learning. Magic, in her view, is not an unnatural force but a seed of creation, meant to be cultivated responsibly and never squandered. True wisdom comes not just from study, but from action, for only those who tend the earth, nurture others, and seek deeper truths can claim to walk Demma’s path. 
Vestments of the Clergy of Demma

The vestments of Demma’s clergy reflect her domains of fertility, crops, households, childbirth, and magic, blending practicality with symbolic richness. The standard attire consists of a long tunic in earthy tones—deep greens, golden yellows, or rich browns—embroidered with intricate seed-like patterns along the hem and cuffs. Over this, they wear a sleeveless outer robe or mantle, often dyed in deep red or russet, representing the life-giving blood of birth, the warmth of the hearth, and the ripened bounty of the harvest. A broad, gold-threaded sash or belt is worn around the waist, often adorned with woven charms, seed pouches, or small flail-shaped talismans.

For ceremonial occasions, high-ranking priests don a hooded cloak fastened with a bronze or gold brooch in the shape of a seed, symbolizing Demma’s hidden wisdom and the potential for growth. Their sacred weapon, the flail, is often incorporated into their attire—miniature versions hang from prayer cords, while elaborately crafted ceremonial flails are carried during important rites and blessings. Unlike the elaborate robes of some faiths, Demma’s vestments are designed to be worn while working—whether blessing fields, tending the sick, or studying ancient texts—reinforcing the belief that faith is meant to be lived, not merely displayed.

Ioannes’ personal attire, with deep blue tunic, golden embroidery, and a red woolen cloak fastened with a bronze brooch, is slightly more ornate than the average rural cleric, reflecting his scholarly leanings and broader understanding of Demma’s role in magic and wisdom. However, his disheveled state, ink-stained fingers, and perpetually askew sash betray his absentminded nature, setting him apart from the more disciplined priests of Gosterwick.
Structure of the Priesthood of Demma

The priesthood of Demma is hierarchical yet practical, structured to reflect the goddess’s emphasis on stewardship, growth, and responsibility rather than rigid authority. Unlike the bureaucratic orders of war gods or the secretive cults of magic, Demma’s clergy are expected to serve actively, ensuring fertility, healing, and wisdom flourish within their communities.

At the local level, each temple is led by a Chief Priest, like Vivian in Gosterwick, who acts as both a spiritual leader and a caretaker of the temple’s resources. Chief Priests are often selected not just for their faith, but for their ability to lead, teach, and manage the temple’s obligations to the community. They oversee a small council of assisting clerics, usually four to eight in number, who handle day-to-day rituals, agricultural blessings, midwifery, and magical healing.
While some temples remain deeply tied to local farmers and households, others, especially in larger cities or scholarly centers, emphasize Demma’s role in magic and hidden wisdom. These more esoteric branches, sometimes called “Seedkeepers,” guard ancient agricultural knowledge, sacred fertility rites, and the interplay between magic and the natural world. Though they share the same core beliefs, rural clergy tend to focus on practical aid, while scholarly priests, like Ioannes, often seek to recover lost wisdom.

Temples are also protected by dedicated warriors, known as Harvest Guardians, who serve both as defenders of the faith and enforcers of Demma’s justice. Each major temple has a contingent of six to twelve fighters, trained in flail combat and sworn to defend the temple’s resources, assist the faithful, and root out those who corrupt the cycles of life.

Though Demma’s clergy are not warlike, they believe in maintaining balance, and those who hoard food, abuse their households, or twist magic for selfish ends may find themselves facing the goddess’s retribution—delivered by the very hands that once blessed them.
