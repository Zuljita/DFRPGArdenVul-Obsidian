Ioannes learns (or already knew) a few things.  Set was a Greater God of the old pantheon, the Ten.  He was the god of power, knowledge, domination, slavery, vengeance, and serpents.  His followers were known for their Was sticks, Set animals (weird mean dogs with square ears), and red scale armor.  There was known to be a Temple of Set in Arden Vul.  Worship of Set was banned by imperial decree in 1839 AEP, more than a thousand years ago.  The Drome claimed to have successfully eliminated the cult everywhere in the Empire shortly afterward.  There is allegedly a Forum of Set in the ruins of Arden Vul to this day.  There are rumors that the Settite Guild of Service is still buying and selling slaves.

Ioannes will not only relay this, but also his earlier finding that an ancient rescript from the high priest of Set to his counterpart in Archontos claims that the Set temple in Arden Vul succeeded in breeding a fearsome species of animals that 'shared all the attributes of Lord Set.' The project was based in a secret cavern located near the waterfall, and presumably the creature in question was a kind of golem.
