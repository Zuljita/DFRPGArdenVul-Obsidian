I'd like to try seeker for Gwelf
dripton (GM) — 8/1/2025 2:56 PM
I don't see Seeker on your sheet, updated July 25.
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 8/1/2025 2:57 PM
That's weird, it's a prereq for things.
lemme check?
I stand corrected, it's a prereq for other things I don't have yet.  I'll buy it now.
It'll be 15+1 for bless. updated sheet incoming
dripton (GM) — 8/1/2025 3:05 PM
You see the vision of Gwelf's dead body.  He's got a huge cutting wound across his torso.  He's underground, in a dark cave you don't recognize.  You're too far away to get a direction reading.
Archon Shiva (Grudge Brigade) — 8/1/2025 4:16 PM
Cast Pathfinder for “underground dark cave I don’t recognize”.  😝
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 8/5/2025 3:57 PM
Ioannes will Research the Litany of Light, and use Alchemy to brew a Magebane potion
dripton (GM) — 8/5/2025 3:59 PM
Research: Your sources indicate that the Litany of Light book you found is a fraud, and trying that ritual probably won't work and might have negative consequences.
Alchemy: Failure, you made the potion but have to pay extra because it took two tries.
Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 8/7/2025 3:42 PM
Vallium will brew a Strength potion.  Vallium will spend $125 to have a Carousing +2 roll.  Vallium will look to purchase in town: Heavy Scale Body Armor that is Fine and/or possesses Lighten enchantment.
dripton (GM) — 8/7/2025 3:44 PM
Alchemy: ooh, that did NOT go well.  You spent all the money and your potion caught fire.  Fortunately the Arcane Practitioners Club alchemy lab is designed for this kind of thing
Carousing: You run into Dalton at the Stunned Acolyte.  He tells you that he's currently trying to find a way past the Obsidian Gates.  He says as far as he can tell, nobody has reported making it past them; even Lockmaster and Blink spells don't help.  So there must be good treasure back there.
Armor: Torunn is supposed to be the best armorer in Gosterwick.  She does not have any Fine heavy scale in your size available, but can craft you some.  Half the money down, half when it's done.  She does not currently have any armor with Lighten. 
dripton (GM) — 8/7/2025 3:51 PM
Also she needs to know if you want a full face helmet or one that gives better visibility.  She doesn't know how to do both at once without magic.
Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 8/7/2025 3:54 PM
Vallium was requesting just Fine Heavy Scale Body Armor, not Fine Heavy Scale Suit.  (As he cannot afford that).  Vallium will hold off on that deposit.
dripton (GM) — 8/7/2025 3:55 PM
Seeing that you're not ready to buy the armor yet, she holds off on her attempt to sell you both helmets so that you can mix and match depending on the challenge.
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 8/7/2025 11:14 PM
Weekly scrying from town:
Pathfinder: "right" way to the troll lifts
Seeker: Lillian
dripton (GM) — 8/7/2025 11:17 PM
Pathfinder: unclear
Seeker: You see a woman in a prison cell.  She is in bad physical shape as though she's been beaten.  She is gagged and bound.  The cell appears to be indoors and lit by Continual Light.  There are bars on two sides of her cell, and the other two sides are stone walls.  You see a goblin in the cell next to her.
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 8/7/2025 11:28 PM
I'll try trace on Lilian
(Just bought)
dripton (GM) — 8/7/2025 11:30 PM
You have a Trace on Lillian.  She's to the north.  You don't get any feeling that she's moving around much.  The Trace lasts until you go to bed, then expires.
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 8/7/2025 11:31 PM
No sense of relative altitude?
(the spell's a little vague, so who knows?)
dripton (GM) — 8/7/2025 11:32 PM
The direction is mostly north, toward the ruins.  The altitude difference is too small to notice, compared to the general sense of north.
Archon Shiva (Grudge Brigade) — 8/8/2025 9:25 AM
Continual Light, or Perpetual Light’s distinctive orange hue?
dripton (GM) — 8/8/2025 9:26 AM
He did not notice any orange.
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 8/10/2025 11:39 AM
Ioannes will brew some paut (and just buy the healing potions, since his great healing potion made its save). I presume Ioannes will bug @Cosmo (Uvash) to get a new Bless beforehand if that's permissible (though it's Contingency Casting and thus on a per-session basis; he can recast Bless on Uvash beforehand as well, if you want to make that roll, too, drip)
dripton (GM) — 8/10/2025 11:42 AM
Alchemy: success, you made Paut at a discount.
Other stuff: Contingency Casting is only during sessions not between; that has to wait for Uvash to make the call, during the next session.
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 8/10/2025 11:43 AM
Ioannes will research the obelisk this week
dripton (GM) — 8/12/2025 8:47 AM
You find a reference in the Book of Priors to some ancient obelisks that the Thothians discovered while building their temples under Arden Vul.  The obelisks appeared to be related to the demon-worshipping hoppers.  It appears they were built around rather than destroyed, for some reason.
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 8/12/2025 5:19 PM
Pathfinder: "right" way to the troll lifts
dripton (GM) — 8/12/2025 5:20 PM
You do not sense a path.
Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 8/13/2025 7:15 PM
Vallium will brew a Strength potion.  Vallium will spend $125 to have a Carousing +2 roll.
dripton (GM) — 8/13/2025 7:15 PM
Alchemy: fail, pay extra
Carousing: Watch out for lingering magical effects! They're all over the place. For example, the Thoth priests loved teleportation. Watch out for doors marked with an ibis, since they'll teleport you to a new location.
Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 8/31/2025 11:18 AM
After a day or so, before Lillian heads back to Newmarket, Vallium will pay her a visit.  He has two requests of her.  One, to deliver a letter of introduction to the temple of Thoth in Newmarket, describing some of the Thothian features R4R has uncovered, in particular the Library of Thoth which could benefit from some curation.  Second, he asks Lillian what she knows about the Tower of the Ape in Newmarket.
dripton (GM) — 8/31/2025 11:22 AM
Lillian agrees to the delivery of the letter of introduction.  She says that everyone in Newmarket knows that the Tower of the Ape is owned by a reclusive Archontean wizard named Tikun Thane, who she has never actually met.  She has heard that he has apes inside, but has not personally confirmed this.
Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 8/31/2025 11:24 AM
Vallium asks if the apes are said to be either albino, or 4-armed?
dripton (GM) — 8/31/2025 11:26 AM
Lillian says that she has not heard anything about apes with 4 arms, but she did hear a rumor that some of them were white.  She repeats that this all may just be made up, as she's never actually been in the tower or met Tikun Thane or seen any apes.
Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 8/31/2025 11:28 AM
Is there any indication in the stories about Tikun Thane if his attitude towards the apes are beneficient and caring or cruel and domineering?  Or unknown?
dripton (GM) — 8/31/2025 11:33 AM
Lillian says she does not know Tikun Thane and has not heard anything about him being cruel to his alleged apes.
Lillian excuses herself and says she has a meeting at the House of Sight to share her experience with the Cult of Set with the authorities.  You notice that she takes Azgallatu and 2 other large armed clerics with her to her meeting, even though it's only a few blocks south. 
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 8/31/2025 2:08 PM
Ioannes is going to do a hurried Research project on the Settite cult
dripton (GM) — 8/31/2025 2:18 PM
Ioannes learns (or already knew) a few things.  Set was a Greater God of the old pantheon, the Ten.  He was the god of power, knowledge, domination, slavery, vengeance, and serpents.  His followers were known for their Was sticks, Set animals (weird mean dogs with square ears), and red scale armor.  There was known to be a Temple of Set in Arden Vul.  Worship of Set was banned by imperial decree in 1839 AEP, more than a thousand years ago.  The Drome claimed to have successfully eliminated the cult everywhere in the Empire shortly afterward.  There is allegedly a Forum of Set in the ruins of Arden Vul to this day.  There are rumors that the Settite Guild of Service is still buying and selling slaves.
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 8/31/2025 2:23 PM
Ioannes will not only relay this, but also his earlier finding that an ancient rescript from the high priest of Set to his counterpart in Archontos claims that the Set temple in Arden Vul succeeded in breeding a fearsome species of animals that 'shared all the attributes of Lord Set.' The project was based in a secret cavern located near the waterfall, and presumably the creature in question was a kind of golem.
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/14/2025 9:57 PM
Vael would like to ask around using the people and skills he used to develop streetwise and merchant, as well as his usual friends like Creon about Wicktrimmer, Lost and Found and the Rarities factor, their reputation, their capabilites, their trustworthiness and so on.  Just trying to do his due dilligence.
(He won't go anywhere alone though)
(he'll also be wearing the Larel cloak)
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/14/2025 10:15 PM
and the amulet of voice.
dripton (GM) — 9/14/2025 10:15 PM
You learn the following: Wicktrimmer is a retired adventurer, who used to plunder Arden Vul with a group called Lost and Found.  Lost and Found was led by the wizard Balthazar the Blue and the paladin Grimley.  Wicktrimmer founded the Rarities Factor in Gosterwick 12 years ago, then expanded to another location in Newmarket, then a third location in Narsileon.  They provide the same services (banking, letters, mule caravans) as the other Factors, but at a slightly cheaper price, and a smaller geographical range.  He is possibly the second richest person in Gosterwick, and definitely the richest goblin.  He is a collector of both historical treasures and magic items.  He is apparently friends with all the other important people in Gosterwick, such as the Green Lady.  His reputation is very solid.  He seems to know everything that happens in town, and everyone has a different theory why.
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 9/15/2025 11:39 AM
Ioannes will do Research on Lost and Found and the Rarities Factor
dripton (GM) — 9/15/2025 11:52 AM
You find that Lost and Found had some unbelievable exploits that were probably made up.  This Balthazar guy seemed to have been big on self-promotion.  The Rarities Factor appears to be a banking factor in Gosterwick and Newmarket, but the story that Wicktrimmer is the owner seems doubtful.  There's probably a rich noble behind the scenes, but you don't find who.
Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 9/16/2025 8:32 PM
Vallium will brew a Magebane Grenade.  Vallium will spend $125 to have a Carousing +2 roll.
dripton (GM) — 9/16/2025 9:35 PM
Vallium added too much nightshade and the attempted magebane really stunk up the alchemy lab and he needed Vael to cast Purify Air.  +10% to cost.
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 9/16/2025 9:36 PM
Ioannes will brew paut (hear that, Vael?)
dripton (GM) — 9/16/2025 9:40 PM
Vallium hears "There’s access to a Sunless Sea somewhere underneath the Halls. An ogre boatman will sell passage across it."
Ioannes successfully made some paut.
