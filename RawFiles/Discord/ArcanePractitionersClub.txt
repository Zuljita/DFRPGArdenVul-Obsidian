The Arcane Practitioners Club let you use their Alchemy lab for free this time.  (They charge a monthly membership fee to use their alchemy lab and small research library, and also do magical training, magic item identification, and spellcasting for hire.  They also have a few  apartments for rent for members.  Their building is within the theoretical boundaries of Gosterwick and will be inside the wall when it's finished, but it's currently pretty far away from all other buildings.)

Two known NPCs who seem to be in charge are Pelteon, a younger female mage, and Lyssandra, an older female mage. Pelteon is vain and looking for an apprentice (Ioannes is pathetically trying to hit on her); Lyssandra seems to be more practical (edited)Sunday, March 16, 2025 10:17 PM
APC membership is $50/month, gets you library/lab/lounge access.  Other stuff costs more. This is $13/week
Other stuff at APC: they ID magic stuff (magery, detect magic, analyze magic, alchemy, Mithric).  They teach magic spells and skills (they know most spells, plus skills that wizards use like Thaumatology and Alchemy and Research, and can try to help teach you Wizardry advantages).  They buy some magic items if they want them, refer to smith or pawnshop for stuff they don't want.  They have a few apartments for rent in their building.  (Normal cost of living but you have to be a member, so it's $150 /week + $50 /month.)

Those above are copy/paste from dripton

@dripton (GM) What else do we know about this club?
dripton (GM) — 3/16/2025 2:28 PMSunday, March 16, 2025 2:28 PM
Lyssandra seems interested in buying any Mage scroll containing a spell she doesn't already know.  (Presumably that includes spellbooks too.)
[2:28 PM]Sunday, March 16, 2025 2:28 PM
She seems to know a lot of spells, so this probably means rare or weird spells.
[2:32 PM]Sunday, March 16, 2025 2:32 PM
Also, you heard that Pelteon used to be Lyssandra's apprentice, but now seems to be a partner in the business, with the exact status of the two unclear.

What about this can we flesh out safely?
dripton (GM) — 3/16/2025 2:44 PMSunday, March 16, 2025 2:44 PM
I'm sure you can figure out a lot in play.
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 3/16/2025 2:44 PMSunday, March 16, 2025 2:44 PM
OK
dripton (GM) — 3/16/2025 3:38 PMSunday, March 16, 2025 3:38 PM
Oh they can also recharge Mage Power Items.
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 3/16/2025 4:40 PMSunday, March 16, 2025 4:40 PM
I assume cleric ones get recharged at the temple
[4:40 PM]Sunday, March 16, 2025 4:40 PM
Who are all the NPCs there, or are the two we met the only two?
dripton (GM) — 3/16/2025 5:18 PMSunday, March 16, 2025 5:18 PM
Those are the only two you have met.
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 3/16/2025 5:19 PMSunday, March 16, 2025 5:19 PM
How bad did the one (Pelteon, right? Named after a treadmill?) react to Ioannes’s attempt to hit on her
dripton (GM) — 3/16/2025 5:19 PMSunday, March 16, 2025 5:19 PM
She appeared not to notice.

What facilities exist at the APC for brewing potions?
dripton (GM) — 4/12/2025 6:21 PMSaturday, April 12, 2025 6:21 PM
They have an alchemy lab.
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 4/12/2025 6:21 PMSaturday, April 12, 2025 6:21 PM
Standard equipment? Or another level? (edited)Saturday, April 12, 2025 6:21 PM
dripton (GM) — 4/12/2025 6:21 PMSaturday, April 12, 2025 6:21 PM
