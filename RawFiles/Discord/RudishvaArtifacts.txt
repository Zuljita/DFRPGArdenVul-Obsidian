You read the book "Rudishva Devices".  It has pictures of a bunch of Rudishva devices, and some of the pictures look like some of the stuff the others found, so you can now put names on items in the loot sheet.  You also think that experimenting with the devices might be somewhat safer if you open the book to the right page and read all the warnings there before you touch anything.  But the writing is confusing and some of the devices look the same so you're not entirely sure, and you think it might make sense for some of the others to repeat your research before you start messing with any of the items, if you prioritize safety over speed.
