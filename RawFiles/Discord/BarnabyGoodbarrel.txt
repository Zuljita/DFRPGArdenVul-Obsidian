There is one available, Barnaby Goodbarrel, a halfling.  He charges $100 for an initial consultation, then once you tell him what you need he will tell you more.
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/15/2025 12:57 PM
Feel free to move this somewhere else if you'd rather, but I'm totally down paying Mr. Good barrel for a consultation.  I want to establish two things: a company charter and evaluate the draft Mr. Wick trimmer and I discussed
dripton (GM) — 9/15/2025 1:42 PM
Goodbarrel tells you that a company charter for Gosterwick is routine but requires approval from Eusebia Phokas, the Thesmothete of Vetucaster.  That would cost $500 and would probably take a few weeks for approval.  That's just for Gosterwick.  If you wanted to do business over a larger geographic area it would get more complicated.
He says the draft contract with the Rarities Factor looks reasonable but he would write more precise language around the right of first refusal.  He looks intrigued that you found something worth $20k but avoids prying, and says that as long as it belongs to your group, the sale should be fine.
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/15/2025 1:48 PM
I'd like to get his wording, and to incorporate the grudge brigade feedback.  A local incorporation should be fine for now. I can pay 750 if he can rush it
dripton (GM) — 9/15/2025 1:49 PM
He agrees to make it his top priority and get the matter in front of the Thesmothete quickly, but says he can't control whether it gets approved or how long that takes.  His experience is that most reasonable businesses get approved though.
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/15/2025 2:13 PM
I'd like the signatory to be the company, not 5 people.  That's what I want to hold for. While he waits for the Thesmothete (autocorrect didn't like that) I'd like a draft that better represents our interests for the agreement for the artifact.
dripton (GM) — 9/15/2025 2:25 PM
He says he'll have the draft ready when your company is approved; he cautioned that you cannot sign a binding contract as a company until then.
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/16/2025 12:23 PM
I'd like to swing back by wick trimmer and ask if he knows anyone who can move our paperwork to the top of the pile at the Thesmothete.  That I think we can close the deal soon, I just need to finish our articles of incorporation.
dripton (GM) — 9/16/2025 12:25 PM
Wicktrimmer recommends Barnaby Goodbarrel, the second best lawyer in Gosterwick.  "I already have the best one so you probably shouldn't use her."
He says "Lady Alexia is strongly in favor of people forming companies here so I don't think you'll have any trouble."
Your application for incorporation is approved late on Tahsday.
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/16/2025 12:27 PM
That's fantastic! Now I want to swing back by Mr. Good barrel's office and take a look at the new proposed contract
I have suspicions. I may be in real danger of needing to take a point in administrator soon...
dripton (GM) — 9/16/2025 12:29 PM
It looks fine to him except he wants to add a couple of clauses in Mithric.  He says that per the bylaws of your company you need 3 out of 5 members to vote in favor. 
He says "I don't know the exact details of this artifact and I probably don't need to know, but as long as you own it, it's fine to sell it to the Rarities Factor.  But this is a lot of money so make sure to get the signatures."
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/16/2025 12:32 PM
Out of character should I expect from a lawyer who works for me the same kinds of things I would expect as a modern person in terms of confidentiality and operating in my best interest?
dripton (GM) — 9/16/2025 12:32 PM
Exact rules vary from place to place but he's supposed to operate in the interest of his client.
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/16/2025 12:34 PM
I'm willing to divulge whatever details the lawyer feels would help him. Best advise me but in return I'm going to expect him to execute some sort of confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement between us and I'm happy to keep him on retainer
dripton (GM) — 9/16/2025 12:37 PM
He pulls out a standard retainer form that includes a confidentially clause.  It has a starting fee of $500.  He says your first $500 of legal work comes out of that and as long as there's anything left in the retainer he's on-call to do any work you need in Gosterwick and you have priority over any other client who tries to retain him later.
He says the $750 you already paid covered the work already done, so this retainer is only for future work.
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/16/2025 12:40 PM
Done and done and then I'll explain the artifact
dripton (GM) — 9/16/2025 12:41 PM
He says "whoa, I always assumed Larel was fictitious.  Well I can see why Wicktrimmer would pay so much for it."
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/16/2025 12:44 PM
As someone with a reputation and a history here in gosterwick, do you see any reason to believe he can't deliver on his side of the list of things he said he'd do?
dripton (GM) — 9/16/2025 12:46 PM
"He has a reputation for keeping his word.  He also has a reputation for knowing everything that's happening in town, and I have no idea how.  I know he hires wizards though."
"He's competing against Imperial Factors with hundreds of years of reputation, so if he messes up once, he's done.  So I think he has plenty of motivation to do the right thing."
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 9/16/2025 12:48 PM
Thanks!  I think we're official now and I'll be seeing you the next time there's something within your wheelhouse. Just to be clear, this is not the only significant artifact we've found and I don't expect it to be the last. Anytime you can represent my interests even in ways I didn't expect, I will pay for.
