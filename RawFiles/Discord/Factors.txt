@dripton (GM) when time permits, could you possibly refresh details here?  Here's what I remember:
Silent factor - dress in black with veils, use a kind of sign language with interpreters, highest storage fee, highest security and most privacy
Rarities factor - led by local goblin named Wicktrimmer, lowest storage fee (now free for party due to deal for larel's dagger), willing to house non-cash goods.
Prosperity Factor -

There are 3 Empire-wide factors: Prosperity Factor, Silent Factor, and Golden Band.  The Rarities Factor only has locations in Narsileon, Newmarket, and Gosterwick.
Of the 3 in Gosterwick, Rarities is cheapest, Prosperity is medium, Silent is most expensive.
The 3 statue brokers at the Inn of the Broken Head work for the Prosperity Factor, the Golden Band, and the Wisdom Factor.
Newmarket has all 5 of the named Factors.  Narsileon has more.
