@everyone On starting rumors:  When I tell you your PC is approved and you put the GCS file in the Current Character Sheets thread under ⁠character-sheets to indicate that it's done, you're eligible for rumors.  I will only roll rumors for PCs before the first week they're actually going to be played, so only 1 of Shiva's 3 substitute PCs gets a rumor this week and Greybrown's will wait until next week.  I will send you the rumors by Discord PM; you can do whatever you want with them: share on Discord, wait and share in-character, never share, whatever.  If you want to change an already-approved PC at the last minute, and you try removing a trait that gave you extra or better rumors, I will make a loud buzzing noise.

Vael rumor 1 "The priests of Mitra are looking for some chumps to track down one of their missing clergy, a priestess named Lillian. It seems she went missing by that  huge overgrown Thicket down near the cliff of Arden Vul. We ran into a shepherd who claims he saw her being taken by walking pigs up the cliff into the ruins
of Arden Vul. If you can find and return this Lillian, there's a big reward posted in Newmarket."
Vael rumor 2 "Thoth was deeply important to the ancient empire, as he represented the light of knowledge that erased the darkness of ignorance. For this reason, the Thoth priests were obsessed with light; every one of their Halls remains brightly lit with Thoth's bright, clear, light."

 "The caverns under Arden Vul produced a large supply of a wondrous orange mineral that proved to have very many arcane uses. The city was abandoned when the mines ran dry."

@everyone in case you missed it, my rumors and AS's are here, anyone who wants to share would do well to do it here.

 Gog is this barmy old goblin who lives in an underground grotto near the arena. He's eager to barter information for meat, especially beastman meat. If you do, he'll tell you a sob-story about how he was exiled from the goblin court due to the treachery of another goblin named Mook.

  Thoth may have represented the light of knowledge, but he was also the guardian of secrets. He favored those who acquired and guarded knowledge, and himself only revealed the most potent of his wisdom to the devout. There is said to be a chamber in the Upper Halls where, if one listens through an enormous horn, one can hear Thoth speak directly.

 On the eighth level underground you can find a grotto filled with giant carved heads. The heads sing in recognizable tunes!  If you can get them to sing the right tune, they reveal a treasure vault. If they sing the wrong song, however, everyone dies.

 The ancient cult of Set was known for its belief in the natural right of the  strong to dominate the weak. As a central part of this dogma, it operated its own slave trade, which it called "the Guild of service."

 The Set priests are slavers. Anyone they encounter on the Long Stairs leading to their Forum is liable to be enslaved. If you make it to the Forum, though, you're safe.

 2️⃣
 The Pyramid of Thoth in the ruined city leads directly to the topmost of the many underground levels; beneath it are at least a dozen other levels, culminating in a huge cavern and lake at the bottom.

 1️⃣
 At the foot of the chasm is a huge cistern the size of a lake. The cistern is 100' deep and covers the area of a small town. It is ruled by a terrible kraken.

 2️⃣
 Marius Tricotor had his sorcerers create a magical bridge out of stone. This bridge, called the Imperial Span, crossed the Great Chasm, and allowed the archon's troops to move into the lower levels.

 Everyone talks about the Drowned Canyon and all its wealth, but I don’t know an adventurer who admits to actually having found the damned canyon!.  The entire thing is a myth.
👑
 2️⃣
 The Thoth priests built numerous statues of their god. These appear in various  forms, including ibis-headed and baboon- headed. The eyes of all these statues were made of huge gemstones, which if removed allowed the bearer to contact  Thoth directly. Many of the statues were enchanted.

Carousing: Vallium hears from Azgallatu the cleric (who was in Newmarket with Lillian but is back in Gosterwick) that Lord Iskander Burdock (Lady Alexia's half brother) has been recruiting adventurers to delve into the Halls.  He's been offering equipment in exchange for a 50/50 split of the treasure.

Rumor 1: "We met a crazy hermit in the ruins of the city. His stew is foul, but if you eat with him, he'll give you some good directions. For instance, there's a staircase hidden behind a painted image of a baboon; it leads down to what the hermit called 'the scene of the crime'."

Rumor 2: "Many of the most ardent devotees of Thoth, known as Thoth's Beloved, were buried in a set of catacombs located just under the pyramid. They are guarded by the power of Thoth himself, which has prevented all intruders from entering the catacombs."

Rumor 1: A unique source of magical energy exists inside the plateau, drawing both creatures and inquisitive mages. It can be  manipulated by powerful mages for good ... or for ill. Look for the orange rocks.
.
Rumor 2: We were waiting to take the lift down to the troll market when a huge troll exiting the lift asked us a question in surprisingly good Thorcin! It wanted to know if we had seen one of its fellow hunters, a troll named Bedara. When we said no, the troll spat and wouldn't say another word. I got the feeling that they'd be real friendly if you could find this Bedara.
.
Rumor 3: Some 250 years ago the emperor sent six cohorts of legionaries, five from the Sheepshead Rangers and one from his own guards tagmata, to recolonize Arden Vul. All six cohorts were lost in a battle fought at the "Cavern of Blood". What is worse, their battle standards were also lost. The archon who led the expedition, a certain Adrienic, committed suicide rather than report his failure.
.

Rumor 4: The Hall of Forty Pillars is right next to the Obsidian Gates. The hall is filled with these creepy albino toads. If the wrong person touches the Gates, the toads turn into demons and attack.
.
Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 4/18/2025 7:07 PM
Rumor 5: The great Thothian wizard, Ptarmis, built himself a secret tomb amid a huge 
forest of colossal mushrooms. We found the fungus cavern on the second level
from the surface, but were driven back before we could locate the tomb by some
sheep- headed critters wielding swords and spears.
Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 4/25/2025 7:04 PM
Rumor 6: A psychotic halfling thug named Plummie, Plumit, or Plum-something has taken
over the top level, just under the pyramid.  He won't let anyone pass unless
they buy an 'exploration license'. I'd pay up, because his goons are armed with potent magic wands.
Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 5/16/2025 7:59 AM
Rumor 7: A terrible dragon is the ruler of the surface ruins of Arden Vul. To access the dungeons you need to sneak past her in the dead of the night, when she's sleeping. I've heard that she extorts a toll on all those she catches exiting the Halls. If you can't pay, she burns you up.
. 
Rumor 8: To find the Drowned Canyon you gotta follow the water, right? I knew an adventurer named Leofwin Rufus who told me that all you had to do was locate the waterfall in the chasm and then follow the river back to the canyon. Easy as pie!
. 
Rumor 9: The green dragon that rules the surface ruins is the daughter of a terrible 
wyrm that lives at the bottom of the Great Chasm within the mountain. This ancient wyrm is twice as old and twice as potent as the green; it is served by a race of deathless, horned skeletons whom the old Empire referred to as 'the survivors' 
Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 5/29/2025 5:25 PM
Rumor 10:  It’s worth trying to get information from anyone whis willing to talk. Most intelligent sorts will be willing to parlay, and a few have seriously good info! Look for a strange half-troll called Gog - he’ll steer you right. It’s the non-intelligent things that you have to watch out for.
. 
Rumor 11: The precincts of the ibis-god are littered with these creepy statues, all of  which have eyes made out of huge gemstones.  If you try to remove the eyes, the statues animate and wreak bloody vengeance.
Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 6/13/2025 6:50 PM
Rumor 12: We visited the Forum of Set and saw the sites. You know, the big statue of Set and the pitiful slaves at his  feet, the marketplace, and so forth. We paid up to attend the First Mystery. Huh, pretty lame! No, I won't  tell you what it is... it's a mystery! But the Second Mystery ... that was impressive! I heard there's supposed to be a Third Mystery, but when we asked the Deacon about it he told us to shut up or we'd be sold as slaves.

Dwarves and dopplegangers have been fighting a war.  Make sure any dwarves you meet are real dwarves.
Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 6/19/2025 8:01 PM
Rumor 13: I saw some dodgy-looking tinkers and trademen making their way for something they called The Forum saying that Stephania paid good money for the most basic supplies. They said "if you want to go to The Forum, shine two lanterns from the left side of the river at night-time.  Then look for the basket on the cliff face."
Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 6/26/2025 12:06 PM
Rumor 14: Everyone uses the old pyramid of Thoth to enter the halls (by the way, check out the gems used for that statue's eyes!  My party leader wouldn't let me grab 'em. Superstitious fool). But because everyone uses that entrance, the areas beneath the pyramid have already been picked clean. I'd suggest finding another route - I heard there was a Shining Well that leads straight to the sweet loot.
Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 7/2/2025 9:46 PM
Rumor 15: There’s a goblin city in the middle levels somewhere. The main entrance is a huge iron gate built into the wall of that Great Chasm that extends down into the depths. Find the great stone seat near Sundered Span, and you can rappel down from there. But be sure to bring tribute, as the goblin king requires a suitable gift to let you in.
Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 7/14/2025 10:56 PM
Rumor 16: Most of the archons of Arden Vul built their tombs under the city, in odd corners of the Halls.  So it’s best to keep an eye out for strange construction and secret passages. I’ve heard that the tomb of Julian Grex is located within a grove of underground almond trees.
Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 7/23/2025 8:37 PM
Rumor 17: We were drinking some of that mushroom ale in the Forum of Set when we overheard some of the red guardsmen whispering about some escaped slaves  causing problems to the north. When we offered help, they turned officious and claimed there was no such thing - nobody escaped the Guild of Service.

Gedrick(?) Malachite says that doppelgangers have been showing up here. He also tells to give every dwarf a good look over, as they might be a doppelganger.
