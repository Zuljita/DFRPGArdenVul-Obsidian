Soft exhalations
Drift from the beak,
As the Lord’s Pneuma
Molds the champion
The Champion’s virtue
Is revealed in humility and wisdom,
While the lies of the proud
Find reward in self-knowing

Lycandus - illusions conceal
his remains. Ptarmis claims he can control the Fungal Foresters.
Horkhari was shown the tomb of great Theskelon, of the Set Cult; it
lies to the east of the Southern Necropolis of Set. Amhit has found the
Obsidian Gates, but has been unable to teleport behind them.

Notes from blackboard (in Mithric)

front:

Beacon=Vehicle - but how does it move?
Fuel is needed.
Arcanum - for what?
Lists of stars and corresponding Rudishva glyphs
Lists of letters and numbers


back:

Crallicarus.  Utterly useless.  Some kind of actor or worse.  Now organizing dramatic readings in the old hopper coliseum near the tomb of Marius.

Sakorikus.  Agreeable and helpful, but neither a leader nor a sage.  Surgical assistant?  Has bizarre theories about the compatibility of human and rudishva fluids.

Ravatorus.  A sage of sorts, with deep knowledge of subterranean and piscine life forms.  Has offered assistance in identifying rare creatures and helping determine their abilities.

Isocrates.  Able warrior, and loyal servant of the empire.  Co-founded Order of the Subterranean Knights but fell out with Melacorius.  Now permanent advisor to the Under-Archon on tactics.

Melacorius.  Strong warrior, of suspect loyalty.  Co-created Order of Subterranean Knights.  Motives opaque.  Hidden base.  Archon wishes to bring him to heel.

Nacalorus.  Rudishva legionary, servant of Melacorius.
