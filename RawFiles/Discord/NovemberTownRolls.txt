Carousing: Vallium attempts the Gauntlet, with Uvash and Vael as wingmen.  This costs $500 (which includes the signature drink at each establishment) and gives a Carousing +3 roll.  Vallium survives the night, but only remembers about half of it.  He learned a couple of interesting things.
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 11/4/2025 10:48 AM
Does Ioannes know anything about Kauket?
dripton (GM) — 11/4/2025 10:48 AM
First, he ran into Geleg, Tresti, Klisko, and Samantha the Red at the Muddy Puddle.  They are part of a new adventuring party called the Second Chance Company.  They relay the news that Plumthorn's Halflings have been defeated by the United Goblns, and the Halls of Thoth have been renamed Upper Goblintown.  They are allowing passage through their territory from all friendly adventuring groups who respect their sovereignty, but request donations of food or alcohol or money.
Second, he talked to a posh wizard named Asrotelion at the Stunned Acolyte.  He revealed that a crazy rogue wizard named Cerbactos stole some priceless unique tomes from the College of Cinders, and Asrotelion has tracked him all the way to the edge of the Empire and it appears he's about 10 miles north, in Arden Vul.    Asrotelion is leaving tomorrow to bring Cerbactos back home.
dripton (GM) — 11/4/2025 10:53 AM
No, this is the first time you've heard of Kauket.  There are so many demons though.
Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 11/5/2025 8:23 AM
Vallium has the quirk "Is terrible at giving bad news", so he will solemnly ask Asrotelion where his remains should be sent.  And then propose (yet another) toast, this time in memory of his new friend "Astrolion".  Each time he is genuine and serious.
Vallium will attempt to brew an Alkahest Grenade.  Vallium will seek out the tailor to commission an embroidered patch, comparable in size to the Halfing-Killer Patch, depicting 11 wooden mugs, to commemorate his recent accomplishment.
dripton (GM) — 11/5/2025 9:12 AM
Alchemy: failure, pay extra
Patch: You are able to commission a custom patch for $25 at Tasha's Tailor Shop
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 11/5/2025 9:58 AM
Was this while Vael was on guard duty?  Vael might try to get some more information about Cerbactos and the tomes using diplomacy once Vallium opens the door.
dripton (GM) — 11/5/2025 11:12 AM
Vael got Asrotelion to reveal that Cerbactos was an archmage who had been a member of the Collegium of Cinders but, a few decades ago, disappeared along with several priceless tomes about magical things that Vael isn't cleared to know.  Whatever bureaucratic functionaries were running the College at the time failed to run an effective search and neither Cerbactos or the books were ever found, which was a stain upon the honor of the College.  However, Asrotelion was recently promoted to Assistant Department Head, gaining the authority to resume the search.  And unlike whoever botched the investigation before, Asrotelion actually managed to cast Seeker well enough to find where Cerbactos had gone.  He expects that when he returns with the tomes, he will be promoted to Associate Department Head.  You will probably read about it in a few months.
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 11/5/2025 11:45 AM
Does vael think this guy is good enough at stuff to bag an archmage? 
dripton (GM) — 11/5/2025 11:47 AM
Hard to tell from just looking at him.  He has fancy robes and talks a good game.
Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 11/8/2025 6:49 AM
After returning to Gosterwick Vallium will head to the temple to check on on the rescuees, and see what he can learn from them.  He'll suggest that Harald seek out the Second Chance Company, and to approach the wizard Geleg, as he might be the most sympathetic considering his own run-in with the Settites.  Vallium will let him know about Susarra, and that even Gosterwick is not safe from Settites without friends to watch your back. Vallium will also ask for any details concerning Harald's old party, specifically any defining features or appearances that would help in recognizing them if they were encountered while delving.

Later on, Vallium will empty out Larel's Sack, put a single empty glass alchemy flask in the Sack, close it up, and then repeated slam the Sack against the floor, before checking to see what has happened to the flask. (I want to know if the Fragile Thoth masks can be stored safely in the Sack, or if they should be kept in Gosterwick and brought forth via the rugs when needed)
dripton (GM) — 11/8/2025 9:21 AM
Bad news: Kiglon, the one with his hands cut off, didn't make it.  The priests did what they could but he died in the night.
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 11/8/2025 9:21 AM
Wow even with fantasy healing!
Archon Shiva (Grudge Brigade) — 11/8/2025 9:22 AM
GM rolled an 18.
dripton (GM) — 11/8/2025 9:23 AM
Good news: Hjalti seems to be making a full recovery.  He tells Vallium that he was captured by the Settites in the Great Cavern and thrown in a slave pit.  They were looking for a "lord of the fungi."  They were also looking for an evil sorcerer named Kerbog Khan, who was wanted by one of the Collegium.  (He doesn't know all the details; his party leader, a wizard named Bjorn, died in the fight with the Settites.)  Hjalti lived for a while in one of the Settite slave pits, but then led an escape attempt.  It failed, and he was staked up to die as punishment. 
The other guy you rescued, Harold, is not at the temple.  Hjalti says he stayed for a bit to make sure he and Kiglon were cared for by the priests, then left.

Uvash would like to research any information about the odd cave we were in with the water and strange looking walls.
dripton (GM) — 11/8/2025 9:38 AM
Uvash does not find anything about that cave.
Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 11/8/2025 7:13 PM
Any similarities between the descriptions of Kernog Khan and Cerbactos, or does the Collegium just make a lot of enemies?

That's all you have right now.
Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 11/8/2025 7:15 PM
Glass in Sack experiment?
dripton (GM) — 11/8/2025 7:16 PM
You managed to break it.
There are now little bits of glass in the Sack and getting them out is taking forever.
Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 11/8/2025 7:18 PM
"Stupid Scientific Method" grumbles Vallium, as he spends an evening  picking out minute glass shards with pricked fingertips.
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 11/9/2025 1:46 PM
How many minor healing potions are available in Gosterwick this week?
dripton (GM) — 11/9/2025 1:54 PM
And Freydis the Stern gives you a suspicious look like "didn't you ask that last week?  How often are you getting hurt?"
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 11/9/2025 1:54 PM
Ioannes will buy all available again, then do research on Ptarmis and brew a Greater Healing Potion
dripton (GM) — 11/9/2025 1:58 PM
Ptarmis was a famous Thothian priest from long ago, back in the early days of Arden Vul, who discovered the Great Cavern and brought it under Archontean control.  He apparently also bred giant mushrooms.  One source said he left his family and church behind to live with his mushrooms, like some kind of weird Druid.
Alchemy: success, discount
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 11/9/2025 2:51 PM
(any sense how long ago that was?)
dripton (GM) — 11/9/2025 2:53 PM
There aren't dates on every source, but roughly 2000 years ago.
Give or take a couple hundred years
Very roughly, Arden and Vul discovered the site around 2150 years ago, the city was founded 2100 years ago, Marius Tricotor finished conquering everything under the Halls around 1950 years ago, and the civil war and abandonment of the area happened around 1200 years ago.
Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 11/12/2025 3:49 PM
Vallium will attempt to brew an Agility Potion.  Vallium will have a copy made of the new key, found in Theskalon's Tomb. Vallium will spend $125 to have a Carousing +2 roll.
dripton (GM) — 11/12/2025 3:51 PM

Locksmith: Theopilos explains that this is a very large and very complicated key, so a copy will cost $25.
Carousing: Vallium hears from Azgallatu the cleric (who was in Newmarket with Lillian but is back in Gosterwick) that Lord Iskander Burdock (Lady Alexia's half brother) has been recruiting adventurers to delve into the Halls.  He's been offering equipment in exchange for a 50/50 split of the treasure.

Uvash wants to ask the illusion a few questions, as well as gathering any basic information he can from the books in the Beacon. (Research for the books, unsure what the other one would be) 
dripton (GM) — 11/16/2025 1:20 PM
Which book to you want to research?  (Topics include Rudishva language, Arden, Archontean golem-like constructs, the "Rudishva spirits", wars between Archonteans and Varumani, Survival/Naturalist/Alchemy, Rudishva artifacts, Arcanum, and gems.)
Cosmo (Uvash)

Rudishva Artifacts then
dripton (GM) — 11/16/2025 1:24 PM
You read the book "Rudishva Devices".  It has pictures of a bunch of Rudishva devices, and some of the pictures look like some of the stuff the others found, so you can now put names on items in the loot sheet.  You also think that experimenting with the devices might be somewhat safer if you open the book to the right page and read all the warnings there before you touch anything.  But the writing is confusing and some of the devices look the same so you're not entirely sure, and you think it might make sense for some of the others to repeat your research before you start messing with any of the items, if you prioritize safety over speed.
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 11/18/2025 6:27 PM
Ioannes will:
Craft a greater healing potion
Look to see how many minor healing potions are available, and buy them
Research town records on the crash of the Beacon and its aftermath
dripton (GM) — 11/18/2025 6:28 PM

Freydis has limited Ioannes to 4 minor healing potions per week, to save some for others.  She hints that this limit might be raised if Ioannes showed some concrete progress toward finding any of Lady Alexia's Regalia.
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 11/18/2025 6:30 PM
Ioannes is fine with this
dripton (GM) — 11/18/2025 6:30 PM
There is nothing at all on the Beacon in any documents Ioannes finds in town.
Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 11/19/2025 10:26 PM
Vallium will attempt to brew a Paut Potion. 

Vallium will spend $125 to have a Carousing +2 roll.

Vallium will ask Theopilos to make copies of the 3 "normal" keys discovered on the shipwreck (Page Reference: 101) as well as the elaborate bronze key (Page Reference: 136).

Vallium will approach Lyssandra and Pelteon to see if they are interested in the following offer: Vallium will give them his Elixir of Health for the purpose of reverse-engineering its recipe, in exchange for them providing Vallium with the recipe should they succeed, and no damages to be awarded should they fail and the potion is destroyed in the process.  They will be free to use the recipe themselves as they see fit.
dripton (GM) — 11/20/2025 9:37 AM
Alchemy: success!  Discounted paut.
Carousing: You spend a lot of money on drinks but you don't hear anything particularly interesting.  It feels like other adventurers are trying to get information from you.  You notice one guy in a robe taking notes of anything you say.
Lyssandra accepts the offer of the free Elixir of Health in exchange for the recipe if she can find it.  The next day, Vallium is given a piece of paper.  It has a potion recipe on it, in precise handwriting, except the ink is a weird purple color and it smells a bit off.
Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 11/20/2025 9:56 AM
Vallium will make a copy of the recipe and pass it along to @Demented Avenger (Ioannes) so he has it available in his personal records.
dripton (GM) — 11/20/2025 9:57 AM
Vallium now has Lyssandra's purple copy and Ioannes now has Vallium's handwritten copy.
Keys: the 3 normal keys are $10 each.  The elaborate bronze key was $25; the copy is the same shape but the handle part is not as elaborate and it is steel not bronze.

Uvash researches Arden.
dripton (GM) — 11/22/2025 10:01 AM
You read several books on Arden.  She is one of the 20 Worthies of the Empire.  She lived around 2100 years ago, though some humans claim she never actually died but rather ascended to demi-godhood.  (This is clearly nonsense, showing that the historical record has been somewhat corrupted over time.)  She and her partner Vul the Sorcerer discovered the cliff and cavern systems that are now the Halls of Arden Vul.  Arden famously completed the 12 Labors, such as defeating owlbears and trolls and undead and dragons and Wiskin berserkers.  Though really only 11 Labors are detailed; the 12th is "still to be done at the time of the Empire's Need."  At the height of their power, Arden and Vul mysteriously disappeared and their bodies were never found.  The city that was later founded above the Halls was named after them.  There was a Cult of Arden among the military officials in Arden Vul, and is is claimed they built their own headquarters in the Halls and attempted to replicate the Labors of Arden.
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 11/22/2025 10:58 AM
Ioannes will research the eyes that activate statues
dripton (GM) — 11/22/2025 11:10 AM
In the back stacks of the Library of Mitra, Ioannes finds a very old book about the ancient Sortians, the traitors under Priscus Pulcher who rebelled against the natural order of having magic controlled by the approved churches and colleges, in favor of just letting any idiot with magical aptitude cast spells.  Their failure to obey the natural order caused the Civil War and the abandonment of the Exarchate of Narsileon and set the Empire back a thousand years.  Anyway, among all their other sins such as summoning demons and letting women and elves hold leadership positions, they apparently made graven images, magical statues of their vain (and rightly executed by a very wise Exarch) leader Priscus Pulcher, that his charmed dupes could worship in various unapproved ways.  Most of them were too disgusting to recount in this book, but one confirmed ritual involved inserting magical eyes of various types into the eye holes of the statues, with effects such as passing messages, teleportation, and causing nearby children to disobey their parents.  The author advises funding a mission to find and destroy any surviving Sortian statues and eyes to prevent their use for evil. 
Kyle (Vael, Zuljita) — 11/22/2025 11:50 AM
In the end who won? the sortians?
dripton (GM) — 11/22/2025 11:52 AM
It was a long civil war and everyone lost.  But the Empire survived, though with smaller borders.  Spell use was eventually opened up.  Some of the old churches lost power and new churches took their place.  Pulcher and the Sortians are still remembered as traitors but most people are fuzzy as to why.
Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 11/22/2025 11:53 AM
The statue we put eyes into had been identified as "The Philosopher" by us (somehow? I forget the details).  Is Priscus Pulcher also known as The Philosopher? 
dripton (GM) — 11/22/2025 11:55 AM
"The Philosopher" is kind of a generic figure.  Priscus Pulcher was an actual historical figure.  He did look kind of like The Philosopher late in his (shortened by execution) life, though.  You're not sure which came first.
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 11/22/2025 11:56 AM
Are there tomes needed for a research library available for purchase in town? These would be helpful for us setting up our own library facilities in Arden Vul, and even collated basic information would be helpful for teaching our magical or sci-fi friends about the world outside
dripton (GM) — 11/22/2025 11:57 AM
Astableon has a bookstore, but it's not a HUGE bookstore.  There are books available but not every book you might want.
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 11/22/2025 12:20 PM
I’m just looking for some simple references, like a single-volume encyclopedia and dictionaries for Archontean and Mithric. Maybe grammar references for those, very basic, like Ars Minor
Very simple bestiary and herbary 
Letting us double check some things, and possibly helping the statue and hologram
dripton (GM) — 11/22/2025 12:22 PM
Yes, Astabelon has books such as The Archontean Empire and Dickios and Janius Learn Mithric.  If you name a budget, he can pick a set of books that match it.
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 11/22/2025 12:23 PM

Greybrown (Vallium Halcyon) — 11/22/2025 1:30 PM
We ask Akla-Chan about burial/funeral rites for rudishva (re: corpse), and show her the glyph that we found on the stone seat.
dripton (GM) — 11/22/2025 1:33 PM
The Rudishva have a few different funeral traditions.  She says Full Recycling is the best but the Beacon currently lacks the ability.  She says Spacing is the second best but the Beacon currently lacks that ability too.  She says Cremation is the third best and might be practical if you have the means to build a suitably hot fire, somewhere outside the Beacon.
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 11/22/2025 1:33 PM
How much is one of the books we're talking about? Trying to get an idea of whether throwing $100, $1,000, or $10,000 at this makes more sense
dripton (GM) — 11/22/2025 1:35 PM
Books vary in cost.  The basic kind you're looking at tend to be $10 to $50 depending on size and number of pictures.  You could make a very small library for $100, a decent one for $1000, and $10000 would be more than Astableon has available right now but he could get right on ordering books for you from Narsileon and let you know as they arrived.
Demented Avenger (Ioannes) — 11/22/2025 1:35 PM
I'll throw $1k at it now, then
dripton (GM) — 11/22/2025 1:35 PM

You now have about 15 general nonfiction books on various subjects.

Vallium will spend $125 to have a Carousing +2 roll at the Stunned Acolyte, because he's run into Dalton there before, and he would like to hear more about the Arena.  He's also going to keep an eye open for any note-taking robed figures.
