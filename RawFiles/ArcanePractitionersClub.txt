The Arcane Practitioners Club let you use their Alchemy lab for free this time.  (They charge a monthly membership fee to use their alchemy lab and small research library, and also do magical training, magic item identification, and spellcasting for hire.  They also have a few  apartments for rent for members.  Their building is within the theoretical boundaries of Gosterwick and will be inside the wall when it's finished, but it's currently pretty far away from all other buildings.) 
Two known NPCs who seem to be in charge are Pelteon, a younger female mage, and Lyssandra, an older female mage. Pelteon is vain and looking for an apprentice (Ioannes is pathetically trying to hit on her); Lyssandra seems to be more practical 
APC membership is $50/month, gets you library/lab/lounge access.  Other stuff costs more. This is $13/week
Other stuff at APC: they ID magic stuff (magery, detect magic, analyze magic, alchemy, Mithric).  They teach magic spells and skills (they know most spells, plus skills that wizards use like Thaumatology and Alchemy and Research, and can try to help teach you Wizardry advantages).  They buy some magic items if they want them, refer to smith or pawnshop for stuff they don't want.  They have a few apartments for rent in their building.  (Normal cost of living but you have to be a member, so it's $150 /week + $50 /month.)

Lyssandra seems interested in buying any Mage scroll containing a spell she doesn't already know.  (Presumably that includes spellbooks too.)
She seems to know a lot of spells, so this probably means rare or weird spells.
Also, you heard that Pelteon used to be Lyssandra's apprentice, but now seems to be a partner in the business, with the exact status of the two unclear.

They can also recharge Mage Power Items.
