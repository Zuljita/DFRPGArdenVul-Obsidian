# Announcing DFRPG Arden Vul (2025-03-05)

## Campaign Overview

The GM decided to run a fantasy megadungeon campaign using "The Halls of Arden Vul" by Richard Barton, written for OSRIC (a variant of Advanced D&D First Edition). The adventure is noted for its huge size (1100+ pages), a well-developed world, and a challenging dungeon.

The campaign uses the Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game (DFRPG) as its base rule set, with specific modifications to character generation and experience point (XP) awards.

## Character Creation Rules (Summary)

- **Point Total:** 125 points for player characters (PCs).
- **Disadvantage Limit:** -25 points.
- **Sense of Duty (Adventuring Companions):** [-5] does not count against the disadvantage limit.
- **Quirk Limit:** -5 points.
- **Templates:** Uses "Five Easy Pieces" from Pyramid 3/113, which are 50-point mini-templates. PCs can afford three Pieces (or two with an expensive racial template). Disadvantage points embedded in a Piece count against the limit.
- **Playable Races:** Dwarves, Elves, Half-elves, Halflings, Humans, and [[Imperial Goblin]]s. Cat-folk, half-orcs, half-ogres, and gnomes are not allowed.
- **Languages:** Languages can be taken at Accented and Broken levels to save points.
- **Starting Money:** Per DFRPG rules, with options to buy [[Wealth]] or trade points for cash.
- **Equipment:** Standard DFRPG: Adventurers equipment is available at list price, except for plate armor (which does not exist in the setting). Some non-magical items can be requested from the GM. Special orders or magical equipment may require availability rolls or travel to larger cities.
- **Coinage:** Uses AD&D coin value ratios with a silver piece standard ($1 = 1 silver piece). A copper is $0.1, a gold is $10, and a platinum is $50.
- **Perks:** "[[Burdock's Valley Local]]" [1] grants extra rumors, an area map, and default [[Area Knowledge]] for the local area.

## Setting Introduction

-   **World Name:** [[Magae]].
-   **Major Power:** The [[Archontean Empire]].
-   **Historical Context:** The old [[Archontean Empire]] (analogous to ancient Rome) expanded across nearby islands and parts of [[Irthuin]]. 1200 years ago, a magical civil war led survivors to retreat to the home island of [[Mithruin]]. The current empire (analogous to Byzantium) is re-occupying old territories. [[Arden Vul]] was a frontier city destroyed in this civil war.
-   **Local Geography:** The play area is [[Burdock's Valley]] (90x80 miles), containing [[Arden Vul]], [[Gosterwick]] (half-day's march south of [[Arden Vul]]), [[Newmarket]] (3 days further south), six small villages, and a couple of castles. Most inhabitants are [[Thorcin]].

## Cultures

-   **[[Archonteans]]**: Rulers of the empire, Byzantine feel.
-   **[[Thorcin]]**: Local population in [[Irthuin]], conquered then independent, now conquered again.
-   **[[Wiskin]]**: Vikings from northern islands.
-   **[[Khumus]]**: Horse nomads from far to the west.
-   **[[Halflings]] & [[Imperial Goblin]]s**: Assimilated into the [[Archontean Empire]], though goblins are second-class citizens.
-   **[[Elves]] & [[Dwarves]]**: Independent, secretive kingdoms outside the Empire.

## Languages

- **Commonly Spoken Near [[Arden Vul]]**: [[Archontean]] (urban/ruling class) and [[Thorcin]] (rural/working class).
- **Ancient Archontean:** [[Mithric]] (dead as a native language, but used for magic, religion, and scholarship). Spellbooks and scrolls are written in [[Mithric]].
- **Racial Languages:** Elvish, Dwarvish.

## Religion

- **[[Archontean Pantheon]]**: Ten major gods and seventeen minor gods.
- **Gosterwick Temples (Full Clerics):**
    - [[Demma]] (goddess of fertility and crops)
    - [[Heschius Ban]] (god of power)
    - [[Lucreon]] (god of wealth and merchants)
    - [[Mitra]] (god of justice and contracts)
- **Other Deities:** Small shrines to other [[Archontean]] major/minor gods and [[Thorcin]] gods in [[Gosterwick]]. [[Newmarket]] has temples to all ten major [[Archontean]] gods, several minor ones, most of the [[Thorcin]] pantheon, and the [[Wiskin]] god [[Odin]].
- **Proscribed Gods:** [[Set]] (illegal worship), [[Horus]] (presumed dead, no spells for clerics).
- **Dwarves**: Monotheists.
- **Elves**: "Spiritual but not religious," lack clerics.

## Game Mechanics & GM Notes

- **Mana:** Normal mana area.
- **Magic:** Well known, studied, and regulated by colleges.
- **Logistics:** Weekly game (Friday nights, 8 PM-midnight NA Eastern Time). 4-5 players. PCs encouraged to return to safe places weekly; points awarded/spent only in safe places.
- **Software:** Foundry VTT, GCS, Discord. Voice game requires a microphone.
- **Spoilers:** Strict "no spoilers" policy for players who have read "The Halls of Arden Vul" or watched actual plays.
- **Difficulty:** Hard adventure, caution needed. Experience with fantasy RPGs recommended; new GURPS players advised to avoid spellcasters initially.

# Arden Vul Character Creation Rules (2025-03-06)

This document outlines the specific rules for character creation in the DFRPG Arden Vul campaign, building upon the Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game (DFRPG) base rules.

## Core Character Generation
- **Base System:** Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game (DFRPG) is the base rules set. Anything from the rest of GURPS requires GM approval.
- **Starting Points:** 125 points.
- **Disadvantage Limit:** -25 points.
- **Sense of Duty (Adventuring Companions) [-5]:** This specific disadvantage does not count against the limit.
- **Quirk Limit:** -5 points.

## "Five Easy Pieces" Template System
- **Method:** Uses the "Five Easy Pieces" character generation option from Pyramid 3/113 (also available in GCS).
- **Mini-Templates:** Consists of 50-point mini-templates.
- **Affordability:** With the given point budget (125 + 25 + 5 + 5 = 160 points effective), PCs can typically afford three 50-point "Pieces," or two if an expensive racial template is chosen.
- **Disadvantage Points:** Disadvantage points embedded within a Piece *do* count against the overall disadvantage limit.
- **Leftover Points:** Any remaining points can be spent on abilities within the chosen Pieces, or on general abilities not restricted to specific templates in DFRPG.
    - Most attributes, skills, and advantages are generally purchasable by any character.
    - Some abilities are reserved for specific templates (e.g., Halfling Marksmanship for [[Halflings]], Turning for Clerics). Players are advised to ask the GM if unsure.

## Playable Races and Languages

- **Available Racial Templates:** Dwarf, Elf, Half-Elf, [[Halfling]], Human, and [[Imperial Goblin]].
- **Unavailable Races:** Cat-folk, half-orcs, half-ogres, gnomes.
- **Native Languages (per race):**
    - **Human:** Choose from [[Archontean]], [[Thorcin]], [[Wiskin]], or [[Khumus]]. Default is [[Archontean]] if none chosen.
    - **Elf:** [[Elvish]].
    - **Half-Elf:** Choose from [[Archontean]], [[Thorcin]], [[Wiskin]], [[Khumus]], or [[Elvish]]. Can take a second native language if raised in both cultures.
    - **Dwarf:** [[Dwarvish]].
    - **[[Halfling]]**: [[Archontean]].
    - **[[Imperial Goblin]]**: [[Archontean]].

- **Important Languages in the Area:**
    - **[[Archontean]]**: More urban and ruling class.
    - **[[Thorcin]]**: More rural and working class.
    - **[[Mithric]]**: The language of the ancient [[Archontean Empire]], currently a "dead" native language but essential for magic, some religions, and scholars. Spellbooks and scrolls are written in [[Mithric]], so mages and clerics should know it.
- **Language Levels:** Allowed to take languages at Accented or Broken levels for fewer points (using GURPS Basic Set rules in GCS).

## Equipment and Economy

- **Starting Equipment:** Per DFRPG rules. Can buy [[Wealth]] or trade points for cash at the start.
- **Available Equipment:** Any non-magical equipment from DFRPG: Adventurers (excluding plate armor, which does not exist in the setting). GM approval needed for common non-magical items not listed.
- **Post-Start Equipment:** Special orders and magical equipment may not be reliably available, possibly requiring availability rolls, travel to major cities, or hiring an enchanter.
- **Coinage:** Uses AD&D coin value ratios with a silver piece standard.
    - **Copper:** $0.1
    - **Silver:** $1
    - **Electrum:** $5 (rarely used)
    - **Gold:** $10
    - **Platinum:** $50
    - PCs can largely use GURPS dollars and ignore exact coins unless weight is a factor. Coins are available in GCS under Home Brew / Arden Vul Equipment.

## Perks

- **[[Burdock's Valley Local]] [1]:** A new perk. If taken, the PC has lived in the [[Burdock's Valley]] area long enough to gain extra rumors, an area map, and default [[Area Knowledge]]. PCs without this perk arrive as outsiders and must ask NPCs for directions.

# Arden Vul: The Archontean Calendar (2025-03-08)

This document describes the structure and unique characteristics of the [[Archontean Calendar]], as it functions within the [[Magae]] world setting of [[Arden Vul]].

## Calendar Structure

-   **Months:** 12 months, each with exactly 30 days.
-   **Year Length:** The year on [[Magae]] is 372 days (compared to Earth's 365/365.25 days).
-   **Intercalary Periods:** To account for the 372-day year, two 6-day intercalary periods are added:
    -   **Mercedonian Days (Days of Wages):** Occurs right after the New Year.
    -   **Voluptarian Days (Days of Pleasure):** Occurs two-thirds of the way through the year, between the eighth and ninth month, coinciding with the harvest festival. This asymmetrical placement makes "faux-historical sense" given typical harvest times.

## Days of the Week

The week consists of seven days, each named after a deity or celestial body:

-   **Basilsday:** Named for the [[Emperor]].
-   **Lunday:** Named for the [[Moon]].
-   **Tothsday:** Named for [[Thoth]] (a Greater God of the old pantheon, no longer popular).
-   **Mitrasday:** Named for [[Mitra]] (a god of the new pantheon).
-   **Tahsday:** Named for [[Ptah]] (a god of the old pantheon).
-   **Horasday:** Named for [[Horus]] (a god of the old pantheon, unpopular and possibly dead).
-   **Demmasday:** Named for [[Demma]] (a goddess of the new pantheon).

## Translation and GM Notes

-   The different year lengths and intercalary periods complicate direct translation between real-world and game-world calendars.
-   The GM typically "wings it" by syncing game seasons with real seasons and using real-world weather analogs.
-   Dates are primarily used for seasonal weather and tracking weekly game progression (as PCs usually delve once a week).
-   The "silly jumble of historical accidents" in the calendar, particularly the inconsistent naming of days, is noted as a realistic touch for a fictional world.

# Cult of Set Research

## Ioannes' Research Project
[[Ioannes]] undertook a hurried research project on the [[Cult of Set]].

### Findings:
- [[Set]] was a [[Greater God]] of the old pantheon, the Ten. His domains included power, knowledge, domination, slavery, vengeance, and serpents.
- Followers of [[Set]] were known for their [[Was sticks]], [[Set Animals]] (weird mean dogs with square ears), and [[Set Armor|red scale armor]].
- A [[Temple of Set]] was known to exist in [[Arden Vul]].
- Worship of [[Set]] was banned by imperial decree in 1839 AEP, over a thousand years ago.
- The [[Drome]] claimed to have successfully eliminated the cult everywhere in the Empire shortly after the ban.
- A [[Forum of Set]] allegedly exists in the ruins of [[Arden Vul]] to this day.
- Rumors persist that the [[Settite Guild of Service]] is still buying and selling slaves.

### Ioannes' Earlier Finding (Breeding Project):
- An ancient rescript from the high priest of [[Set]] to his counterpart in Archontos claims that the [[Temple of Set]] in [[Arden Vul]] succeeded in breeding a fearsome species of animals that 'shared all the attributes of Lord Set.'
- This project was based in a secret cavern located near the [[Waterfall]].
- The creature in question was presumably a kind of [[golem]].

# Demma Lore

## Overview

The [[Temple of Demma]] in [[Gosterwick]] is a modest but well-maintained structure, standing as a place of healing, wisdom, and rural devotion. It is led by Chief Priest [[Vivian]], a stern but fair [[Thorcin]] cleric. He trains new clerics in the mysteries of [[Demma]], believing faith must be practical and service-oriented. The temple prioritizes aid to the rural poor and farmers. Assisting clerics manage daily rituals, bless fields and expectant mothers, and provide limited magical services.

[[Demma]]'s influence spans magic and mystery, but the [[Temple of Demma|temple]] in [[Gosterwick]] is deeply tied to fertility, crops, and households. Its faithful include farmers, midwives, and homemakers, who bring offerings of seeds, bread, and woven charms. The temple is guarded by six dedicated warriors, wielding [[Flail|flails]] in homage to the goddess. Scholars and traveling priests seeking lost magical knowledge remind that [[Demma]]'s influence extends far beyond fields and homes.

## Mythology

[[Demma]] is the Great Nurturer, the goddess who sowed the first seeds of life and ensures the cycles of growth, harvest, and renewal. She is said to have woven the world’s fertility into the land, her touch bringing forth golden fields, strong children, and thriving households. Ancient myths tell of how she stole the secret of magic from the void and planted it within the soil and stars, granting mortals the ability to shape the world through wisdom and will. Though gentle in her blessings, [[Demma]] is unyielding in her wrath—when the selfish hoard, the corrupt abuse, or the wasteful defile her gifts, her [[Flail|flail]] strikes with famine, blight, and barrenness. Worshipers believe that to understand [[Demma]]’s will is to understand the balance of nature, hearth, and spirit, for in her, all things flourish—but only if tended with care.

## Theology

The theology of [[Demma]] centers on balance, stewardship, and the sacred duty of cultivation—whether of land, family, or knowledge. She teaches that fertility and abundance are gifts, but only to those who nurture them with wisdom and toil. To plant without care, hoard without sharing, or wield magic recklessly is to invite ruin. Her faithful are called to protect the cycles of nature, strengthen households, and guide new life. Magic is seen as a seed of creation, meant to be cultivated responsibly. True wisdom comes not just from study, but from action.

## Vestments of the Clergy of Demma

The vestments of [[Demma]]’s clergy reflect her domains. Standard attire consists of a long tunic in earthy tones (deep greens, golden yellows, or rich browns) embroidered with intricate seed-like patterns. Over this, they wear a sleeveless outer robe or mantle, often dyed in deep red or russet. A broad, gold-threaded sash or belt is worn around the waist, adorned with woven charms, seed pouches, or small [[Flail|flail-shaped talismans]].

For ceremonial occasions, high-ranking priests don a hooded cloak fastened with a bronze or gold brooch in the shape of a seed. Their sacred weapon, the [[Flail|flail]], is often incorporated into their attire. [[Demma]]’s vestments are designed to be worn while working, reinforcing the belief that faith is meant to be lived.

[[Ioannes]]’ personal attire, with deep blue tunic, golden embroidery, and a red woolen cloak fastened with a [[Bronze Brooch]], is slightly more ornate, reflecting his scholarly leanings. However, his disheveled state, ink-stained fingers, and perpetually askew sash betray his absentminded nature.

## Structure of the Priesthood of Demma

The priesthood of [[Demma]] is hierarchical yet practical, structured to reflect emphasis on stewardship, growth, and responsibility.

At the local level, each [[Temple of Demma|temple]] is led by a Chief Priest, like [[Vivian]] in [[Gosterwick]]. They oversee a small council of assisting clerics who handle daily rituals, agricultural blessings, midwifery, and magical healing.

More esoteric branches, sometimes called “[[Seedkeepers]]”, guard ancient agricultural knowledge, sacred fertility rites, and the interplay between magic and the natural world.

Temples are also protected by dedicated warriors, known as [[Harvest Guardians]], who serve as defenders of the faith and enforcers of [[Demma]]’s justice. Each major [[Temple of Demma|temple]] has a contingent of six to twelve fighters, trained in [[Flail|flail combat]].

# Dragon Research

## Ioannes' Research Project

[[Ioannes]] brewed a [[Flight Potion|Flight potion]] and researched a dragon.

### Research Findings:

An account from about 50 years ago details an encounter in the [[Arden Vul|ruins of Arden Vul]] involving a huge green dragon. A group of the late [[Lord Burdock]]'s men-at-arms climbed the [[cliff face]] to explore the ruins. They met a huge green [[Dragons|dragon]], and 10 out of the 12 men, including three knights, died. The only survivors were two young men who were kept back to hold horses, and they lost most of the horses and baggage as they fled.

[[Lord Burdock]] then forbade any more of his subjects from going up the [[Long Stair]] to the ruins, lest they anger the [[Dragons|dragon]] further. He also discouraged outsiders from using the [[Burdock Valley]] as a base for exploration of the ruins. This effectively limited exploration of the ruins until his death 25 years ago.

# Ioannes' Journal - The Tower Ghost

## Demmasday, 25th of Lucrios, 2993 AEP

### The Tower Ghost

I found the record. The [[Haunted Tower|tower]] at the base of the [[Waterfall]]—built during the [[Adrienic Expedition]], two and a half centuries past. An attempt by [[Archon Phocion IV]] to retake [[Arden Vul]]. It failed. Bloodily. The [[Haunted Tower|tower]] was left behind when the survivors fled.
And now it is haunted. Or rather, “folklore,” according to one too-convenient source.

I do not trust him. He either never saw the ghost himself, or pretended not to.

I did. The spirit that emerged from that cellar did not wander aimlessly or mutter incoherently. It screamed—accused. “[[Cult of Set|Settite]] murderers,” it said. That is not a random haunt. That is a wronged soul. It is bound, and it is angry.

This is not folklore. This is unfinished business.

[[Demma]] teaches that proper rest follows proper ritual. Perhaps there is something to uncover: a hidden corpse, a desecrated relic, an oath unfulfilled. I will return. Not yet. But soon. And I will put it to rest.

Gods grant that it is no demon. If it is, I will not face it alone.

# Ptarmis Research

## Ioannes' Inquiry

[[Ioannes]] inquired about available [[minor healing potions]] in [[Gosterwick]], prompting a suspicious look from [[Freydis the Stern]], who noted the frequency of such requests.

- He is credited with discovering the [[Great Cavern]] and bringing it under [[Archontean]] control.
- He apparently also bred [[giant mushrooms]].
- One source claims he left his family and church behind to live with his mushrooms, "like some kind of weird Druid."

# Rudishva Artifact Research

[[Uvash]] undertook research on [[Rudishva]] artifacts.

## Reading "[[Rudishva Devices]]" (the book)

- The book contains pictures of various [[Rudishva Devices|Rudishva devices]].
- Some of these pictures match items found by the party, allowing for their identification in the loot sheet.
- Experimenting with the devices might be safer if the warnings in the book are consulted first.
- The writing is confusing, and some devices look similar, leading to uncertainty in identification.
- It is suggested that others should repeat the research before handling items, prioritizing safety over speed.

# Rudishva Funeral Rites

[[Vallium Halcyon]] and the party inquired with [[Akla-Chah]] about [[Rudishva]] burial/funeral rites, prompted by a [[glyph]] found on a stone seat and the presence of a [[corpse]].

## Funeral Traditions

[[Akla-Chah]] explained that the [[Rudishva]] have a few different funeral traditions, ranked by preference:

1.  **Full Recycling:**
    -   Considered the best method.
    -   The [[Beacon]] currently lacks the ability to perform this.
2.  **Spacing:**
    -   The second-best method.
    -   The [[Beacon]] currently lacks the ability to perform this either.
3.  **Cremation:**
    -   The third-best method.
    -   Might be practical if the party has the means to build a suitably hot fire, somewhere outside the [[Beacon]].

# Sortians Research

[[Ioannes]] researches the eyes that activate statues.

## Findings from the [[Library of Thoth]] (Back stacks of the Library of Mitra)

Ioannes finds a very old book about the ancient [[Sortians]], who were traitors under [[Priscus Pulcher]]. They rebelled against the natural order of having magic controlled by approved churches and colleges, advocating for allowing anyone with magical aptitude to cast spells. This rebellion caused the [[Civil War]] and the abandonment of the [[Exarchate of Narsileon]], setting the [[Archontean Empire|Empire]] back a thousand years.

Among their "sins" were:
- Summoning [[demons]].
- Letting women and elves hold leadership positions.
- Creating "graven images" or magical statues of their vain leader [[Priscus Pulcher]] for worship.

One confirmed ritual involved inserting magical eyes of various types into the eye holes of these statues, with effects such as:
- Passing messages.
- Teleportation.
- Causing nearby children to disobey their parents.

The author of the book advises funding a mission to find and destroy any surviving [[Sortian]] statues and eyes to prevent their use for evil.

## Discussion on the Sortian Civil War

- The [[Civil War]] was long, and "everyone lost." However, the [[Archontean Empire|Empire]] survived, albeit with smaller borders.
- Spell use was eventually opened up.
- Some old churches lost power, and new ones took their place.
- [[Priscus Pulcher]] and the [[Sortians]] are still remembered as traitors, though many are unclear on the specifics.

## The Philosopher Statue

- The "Philosopher" is a generic figure.
- [[Priscus Pulcher]] was an actual historical figure.
- He did look similar to "The Philosopher" later in his life, but it's unclear which came first.

# The Living Wheelbarrow Project

[[Ashe Maykum|Ashe's]] [[Alcheboretal Animossities]] is raising funds for [[The Living Wheelbarrow]]!

Regular wheelbarrows are boring, can't be [[Levitation|levitated]], and are a hassle to haul around just to carry the loot. The [[The Living Wheelbarrow|LIVING wheelbarrow]] carries 360 pounds of AWESOME packed with so much plant life you'll look for excuses to [[Levitation|levitate]] it more often.

[[Ashe Maykum|Ashe "The GOAT" Maykum]] has complete his "Shroom for Improvement" prototype and [[The Living Wheelbarrow]] is ready for mass production.

[[The Living Wheelbarrow]] features an underside covered in real living plants, allowing the use of [[Levitation]] rather than [[Apportation]] to move it around. It can be pushed or pulled with only a quarter of the strength necessary to move a ground-based wheelbarrow, and ignores difficult terrain, easily raised or lowered across flights stairs or even vertical shafts through simple caster concentration.

The best part? It requires little more care than a house plant and can survive for days without sunlight.

Available in Fungus White, Moss Green and Yellow Rattle.

The [[The Living Wheelbarrow|Living Wheelbarrow]] is not self-powered, self-propelled or self-levitating. A competent caster and [[Levitation]] spell is required to make use of the levitating feature. [[Scroll]] use by untrained users may result in injury or equipment loss. All designs, components, and plant details are prototypes and are subject to change. Final design, colors, and materials may vary as we continue development and incorporate feedback. We're committed to delivering the best possible product and will keep you updated throughout the process.

## Crowdfunding Pledges

- **Adventurer Pledge:** 300 silver
  - One [[The Living Wheelbarrow|Living Wheelbarrow]] in a color of your choice.
  - Free shipping to [[Gosterwick]].
  - Estimated delivery: Gerakios 2993
- **Party Pledge:** 800 silver
  - Outfit a full party: Get [[The Living Wheelbarrow|Living Wheelbarrows]] in all three colors!
  - Free shipping to [[Gosterwick]].
  - Estimated delivery: Gerakios 2993
- **Trailblazer Pledge:** 2,000 silver (Crowdfunding Exclusive)
  - A personalized wheelbarrow using a mix of plants to feature your own customized color emblem or design on the bottom.
  - Free shipping to [[Gosterwick]].
  - Estimated delivery: Basilembrios 2993

## Discussion

- [[Ioannes]] and [[Onyx]] read through this and look at each other, both befuddled, but saying nothing.
- [[Vael]] expressed interest in a custom design in anarcho-punk lightning blue with a money bag with an arrow on it.
- By September 22, 2025, Adventurer and Party Pledges had been delivered, with focus shifting to Trailblazer pledges.
- [[Ioannes]] received an inquiry about their [[The Living Wheelbarrow|living wheelbarrow]] down in the dungeon.
- [[Vael]] indicated he had already ordered a custom one and intended to sell the old one.

# Tower of Scrutiny Message

## Message from [[Uriel Basileon]] to [[Kel Bormol]]

"In answer to the pious inquiry of [[Kel Bormol]], Overseer of [[Thoth]], [[Uriel Basileon]], most humble [[Archon]], offers this reply. Your assistant, the [[Second Overseer]], has not dared show himself since of his cowardly retreat before the [[Sortian]] onslaught. He cowers within the [[Tower of Scrutiny]], refusing entry to all. Should conditions improve, and should the [[Sortian]] [[Dragons|dragons]] depart, I shall smoke him out of his lair, and deliver him to you for punishment. I should warn you, furthermore, that my agents have noticed a messenger from [[Hithra Paleologos]] obtaining entrance to the [[Tower of Scrutiny]]. I know not what this portends, but it cannot be good. Be warned.”

# Wicktrimmer Negotiations and Research

This document details the interactions and research conducted by [[pcs/Vael Sunshadow|Vael]] and [[pcs/Ioannes Grammatikos Byzantios|Ioannes]] concerning [[Wicktrimmer]] and the [[Rarities Factor]], particularly regarding the sale of [[Larel's Pin]] and other artifacts, as well as general intelligence gathering.

## Initial Inquiry Regarding [[Arcanum]]

- [[Lyssandra Astorion|Lyssandra]] informs [[pcs/Vael Sunshadow|Vael]] and [[pcs/Ioannes Grammatikos Byzantios|Ioannes]] of a note from [[Wicktrimmer]] inquiring about a large quantity of [[Arcanum]] that reportedly showed up in their corner of town. He is interested in buying it.
- [[Lyssandra Astorion|Lyssandra]] expresses surprise, noting [[Wicktrimmer]] is not a wizard and wonders who he's trying to sell it to.
- [[pcs/Ioannes Grammatikos Byzantios|Ioannes]] asks about [[Wicktrimmer]]'s identity, learning he runs the [[Rarities Factor]] and is likely the second richest person in [[Gosterwick]], and definitely the richest [[goblin]].
- [[Lyssandra Astorion|Lyssandra]] advises being polite to [[Wicktrimmer]], as he is not someone to anger.
- [[pcs/Ioannes Grammatikos Byzantios|Ioannes]] asks [[Lyssandra Astorion|Lyssandra]] about [[Arcanum]], learning it's a magic orange metal found in [[Arden Vul]] used as a spell component, though she has never seen it.

## [[Wicktrimmer]]'s Offer to the [[Right for Riches Company]]

- [[Wicktrimmer]] sends a note to the [[Right for Riches Company]] stating he has reliable information they found magical artifacts of deep historical significance.
- He offers lifetime free banking at the [[Rarities Factor]] if his wizard identifies them as genuine and the company sells any to him.

## [[pcs/Vael Sunshadow|Vael]]'s Due Diligence and Negotiations

[[pcs/Vael Sunshadow|Vael]] initiates research into [[Wicktrimmer]], [[Lost and Found]], and the [[Rarities Factor]], wearing his [[Larel's Cloak]] and [[Amulet of Voice]]. [[pcs/Ioannes Grammatikos Byzantios|Ioannes]] and [[pcs/Vallium Halcyon|Vallium]] also contribute to intelligence gathering.

### Initial Research Findings (from GM)
- [[Wicktrimmer]] is a retired adventurer who used to plunder [[Arden Vul]] with a group called [[Lost and Found]].
- [[Lost and Found]] was led by the wizard [[Balthazar the Blue]] and the paladin [[Grimley]].
- [[Wicktrimmer]] founded the [[Rarities Factor]] in [[Gosterwick]] 12 years ago, expanding to [[Newmarket]] and [[Narsileon]].
- The [[Rarities Factor]] offers banking, letters, and mule caravans at slightly cheaper prices than competitors, with a smaller geographical range.
- [[Wicktrimmer]] is possibly the second richest person in [[Gosterwick]] and the richest [[goblin]].
- He is a collector of historical treasures and magic items.
- He is friends with important people like the [[Green Lady]].
- His reputation is solid; he seems to know everything in town, with various theories as to how.

### Visit to the [[Rarities Factor]]
- [[pcs/Vael Sunshadow|Vael]] and friends visit the [[Rarities Factor]]. [[Wicktrimmer]] asks his wizard, [[Ingimund of Arcturus]], to inspect a [[Larel's Pin|letter opener]].
- [[pcs/Vael Sunshadow|Vael]] warns of obfuscation on the item.
- [[Wicktrimmer]] asserts his job is to know of all magic items in [[Gosterwick]], implying magical means of detection. He notes the item was unusually confusing due to its concealing effect.
- The wizard casts Analyze Magic and destroys the [[Larel's Pin|letter opener]] (which was a disguised [[Larel's Pin]]).
- [[Wicktrimmer]] offers $20,000 plus free banking for life for the entire company, for [[Larel's Pin]].
- [[Wicktrimmer]] reveals his past as an adventurer; his party, [[Lost and Found]], reached the [[Obsidian Gates]] but not beyond. He became a merchant after his party leader, [[Balthazar the Blue]], retired due to marriage.
- He notes his dislike for baboons, and is impressed by the party's handling of them.
- He offers payment in gold, silver, platinum, gems, or a letter of deposit.

### [[pcs/Vael Sunshadow|Vael]]'s Counter-Proposal
[[pcs/Vael Sunshadow|Vael]] proposes:
- Sale of [[Larel's Pin]].
- Right of first refusal for their magic items (with exceptions for personal requests, bartering for unique goods/services, or paying adventuring companions).
- Willingness to inform [[Wicktrimmer]] of any items given or traded away.
- In return: $20,000 for [[Larel's Pin]].
- Concierge shopping services in [[Narsileon]], [[Newmarket]], and other agent locations at [[Wicktrimmer]]'s cost.
- Free banking with the [[Rarities Factor]].
- Reports on enemies in town, especially the [[Cult of Set]].

### [[Wicktrimmer]]'s Response to Counter-Proposal
- [[Wicktrimmer]] accepts the proposal as a first draft, advising them not to sell any other found items and to include less valuable items for his collection.
- He expresses personal interest in [[Larel's Mom's Rabbit Soup Recipe]] and other [[Larel]] artifacts, wanting to prove [[Larel]]'s existence to [[Balthazar the Blue]].
- He reveals that [[Lady Alexia Basileon]] and a noble in [[Narsileon]] already hold rights of first and second refusal, respectively.
- He offers a "right of third refusal" in exchange for a reliable [[Teleporter with 400 Mile Range|teleporter with 400 mile range]] or a [[Fast Flying Carpet|fast flying carpet]], citing the inefficiency of mule trains.
- He confirms that concierge shopping services are possible for specific items, with messages reaching [[Narsileon]] in less than a day, but item delivery at mule train speed (around a month). Analyze Magic costs would be on the party.

### Further Research and Political Intel
- [[pcs/Vael Sunshadow|Vael]] and [[pcs/Ioannes Grammatikos Byzantios|Ioannes]] research [[Lost and Found]] and the [[Rarities Factor]].
- **[[Lost and Found]]**: Had unbelievable, possibly made-up exploits. [[Balthazar the Blue]] was big on self-promotion.
- **[[Rarities Factor]]**: Story of [[Wicktrimmer]] owning it seems doubtful; likely a rich noble behind the scenes.
- [[Wicktrimmer]] provides intel on [[Susarra]]'s murder, suggesting an out-of-town [[Cult of Set|Settite]] or hired assassin.
- He mentions [[Keko the Lame]], head of the [[Drome]] in [[Narsileon]], who might pin a medal on them for eradicating the [[Cult of Set]] in [[Arden Vul]].
- He warns of political complexities between [[Lady Alexia Basileon]] and her half-brother, leading to confusion in the Imperial chain of command regarding the [[Drome]] branches.
- He advises caution against assassins and recommends not sleeping in [[Arden Vul]] and not splitting up. If necessary, use 2 guards and Mystic Mist.
- He confirms [[Balthazar the Blue]] now lives in [[Narsileon]], raising kids and making potions, rarely visiting [[Gosterwick]]. [[Wicktrimmer]] visits [[Narsileon]] occasionally but manages the branch remotely.

### Larel Artifacts Provenance Statement (Drafted by [[pcs/Vael Sunshadow|Vael]])

An Account of the Discovery within the [[Thothian Necropolis]], by [[pcs/Vael Sunshadow|Vael Sunshadow]]

"It is a rare privilege to uncover a secret that history has forgotten, and a rarer one still to prove a legend true. Such was our fortune in the deep and silent precincts of the [[Thothian]] halls.

Our explorations led us to a series of forgotten ceremonial chambers, far from the notice of other delvers. We found ourselves in what appeared to be a minor funereal complex. The antechambers were as expected for a minor [[Thothian]] complex, but one sealed door led not to a simple crypt, but to the true prize: the final resting place of a figure many believed to be a myth. There could be no doubt; the walls were dominated by frescos of [[Larel]] himself, depicted in his iconic green cap and with his famous [[Larel's Dagger|dagger]]. The surrounding walls brought his tales to life in painted scenes: [[Larel]] distracting wolves with a chicken, concealing himself from an angry husband, and cleverly spiking apples on his dagger while performing a card trick.

Rather than being interred in a sarcophagus as is common among [[Thothian]]s, the hero's effects were laid out on racks in the chamber, as if waiting for his return. A small rack held a collection of fine, wicked-looking daggers, many with magical auras. Upon a writing desk lay a golden apple next to a simple silver '[[Larel's Pin|letter opener]]'—which we immediately recognized as [[Larel's Pin|Larel's legendary pin]]—alongside three identical love notes to differently named women. In the center of the room, a capped urn rested upon a stone pedestal, containing what can only be the hero's ashes."

- **[[Margot the Red]]**: The innkeeper, a [[Thorcin]] woman.
- **[[Bricwine]]**: [[Margot the Red|Margot's]] husband, who serves as the upper-class bartender.
- **[[Helle]]**: A [[Wiskin]] woman, who tends bar in the main common room.

## Rules and Observations

- The inn staff dislikes people casting spells on the premises, especially if critical failures occur.
- While once a frequent residence for party members, [[pcs/Vael Sunshadow|Vael]] and [[pcs/Ioannes Grammatikos Byzantios|Ioannes]] now stay in the [[Arcane Practitioners' Club]].
