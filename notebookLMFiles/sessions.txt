Unseasonably warm, sunny


Player Characters:

Ioannes Grammatikos Byzantios, Archontean cleric of Demma (Demented Avenger)
Michael J Dundee, Thorcin barbarian (Adam)

6 Knights of the Azure Shield

6 Huge Spiders

Ashe's summoned goats, bat swarms, and rat swarms



## Full Recap



The PCs all came to Gosterwick from various places around the world of Magae, to explore the ruined city of Arden Vul.  Each had decided to look for comrades rather than entering the ruins alone.  Each failed to sign on with an experienced adventuring company, and they decided to form their own informal band, agreeing to watch each other's backs, make decisions together, and split treasure evenly.  The four hired Ashe, a druid from the Grudge Brigade, to come along on this mission, for an equal share of treasure.



They decided to leave Gosterwick at dawn on Demmasday the 14th of Torernios.  Late winter in the northern hemisphere, but it was an unseasonably nice day.  The night before, Vael and Ioannes had cast several bright Continual Light spells, so light would not be an issue if they entered dark places.  (Ioannes critically failed once and accidentally cast Continual Darkness on the bedding in his room at the Yellow Creek Inn instead, oops, hopefully it'll wash out.)  The group walked east out the Water Gate, the only one of Gosterwick's three gates that actually had completed walls around it.  Following directions from several locals, they took a dirty preference path east from the city to the old Imperial Road, once cobblestone now dirt with stone bumps.  The road turned north, crossed the Swift River at a bridge, and continued north.  About halfway into the ten-mile hike, the party was overtaken by a group of six mounted Knights of the Azure Shield, the force aligned with the ruler of Gosterwick, Lady Alexia.  The group made way for the knights, who proceeded down the road without stopping for discussion.  The group continued hiking until they could see the cliff face, featuring a huge waterfall, the twin colossal statues of the ancient heroes Arden and Vul, and the Long Stair.  The ruined city of Arden Vul was known to be at the top of that cliff.  The group reached the base of the cliff around noon.  The sound of the waterfall was deafening as they approached.  Ashe wanted to use Shape Water to concoct some kind of elevator, but to enter that waterfall or its plunge pool without much stronger magic would be certain death.  Vael thought the statue of Arden (which was remarkably intact for something that had been in the path of a waterfall for a millennium) was magical, while the statue of Vul (that was missing an arm and most of a leg despite being much farther from the water) was not.



After a bit of discussion that nobody could hear because of the crashing water, Ashe and his summoned goats started walking up the Long Stair, and the others followed.  The path was treacherous in places, but nobody slipped.  About halfway up, they found a room tunneled into the rock next to the Stair, its door ripped away.  It was a small bare room, empty except for a fire pit and some firewood.  Ioannes suggested a search and the others joined in, but found nothing of interest.



The party continued up the Long Stair to the next switchback, and found another room in the rock, this one larger and containing a lot of debris and some large spiderwebs.  Ioannes and Vael suggested burning them, and Vael used Create Fire to burn the webs away.  This was quite effective but filled the room with noxious smoke.  Rather than waiting for it to clear, Vael cast Purify Air, and rolled a critical success.  The smoke instantly cleared.  Beyond the burned webs was the skeleton of a long-dead dwarven warrior, wearing mail armor and red leather boots, and carrying a potion bottle filled with sparkling blue powder.  Vael thought the boots and powder looked magical and grabbed them.  Uvash decided not to take the dwarf-sized mail, so the group left the heavy mail and the dwarf's warhammer to possibly take on the trip back down.



After spending a bit of time searching the room, the group resumed their hike, and eventually reached the top.  Ahead of them was the front gatehouse of Arden Vul, consisting of two round towers, with the gate that formerly sat between them completely gone.  The left tower was fairly intact, while the right tower was half collapsed.  Ruined walls continued from the gatehouse in both directions.  The group decided to search the towers.  Considering which to check first, one said "left for loot!" but rather than trusting that maxim, Vael cast Seek Earth, looking for gold.  Amazingly, he detected some gold just a few yards to the northwest, meaning it was in the west tower.  Left for loot confirmed.  The tower, while mostly intact, had some gaps in the walls through which entry was possible.  Michael stuck his head in and started to enter, but then saw several dozen eyes looking at him.  There were six huge spiders in the tower waiting to ambush him, and if they had achieved surprise he would have been in very big trouble, but they did not and he popped back out.



With full knowledge of the spiders inside, the group formed up outside the hole, while Ashe sent some disposable summoned rat and bat swarms into the tower to engage the spiders.  While the swarms were engaging some spiders, and Ioannes was casting Flaming Weapon on Michael's longsword, Vael bravely approached the hole and entended his staff inside to cast Create Fire inside the tower.  That was a tactical mistake, as it put the vulnerable wizard in the front as two spiders emerged from the hole, deciding that their tower full of swarms and fire was no longer so cozy.  One spider attempted a Move and Attack on Vael and rolled a hit.  Vael dropped his backpack to reduce his encumbrance level (generously allowed by the GM this time, but maybe not in the future), used a Retreating Dodge, and evaded the spider.  Another spider missed.



While the swarms inside the tower continued to terrorize and spiders and distract them from the PCs, the two spiders outside the tower fought Michael, Uvash, and Vael.  Michael landed a killing blow on one spider, and then a killing critical hit on the other.  Uvash got a good swing in with his mace, but barely missed.  By the time the party entered the tower, they saw one dead spider, killed by a swarm.  The other three spiders had fled.



Remembering there was gold in the tower, Uvash entered and found a sack containing a bunch of oversized ancient gold coins.  Nobody was sure of their exact value, but large plus gold was a good sign.  The group searched the rest of the tower and found nothing of interest.  They then moved to the other half-collapsed tower and saw nothing but a chance to dig in rubble without digging tools.  Ioannes poked around for a bit, but then the group moved on.



The most promising direction was north into the ruined city, since there was a road that way, leading to an obelisk, then a large forum featuring an intact tower, a huge oak tree, and a ruined building.  Further north was a pyramid.  The group first checked out the obelisk, which had a bunch of writing in Mithric (the language of the old empire) listing the gods of the old pantheon and a list of old emperors.  There was also an ankh-shaped recess and some writing about a Beacon.  The top section of the obelisk was full of iconography related to the sun.  They noted the writing and continued north to the forum.



There was a huge oak tree, which Ashe estimated was hundreds of years old, oddly placed in the middle of the forum.  The group was more interested in a mostly intact 40' square and 45' tall tower on the east side of the forum.  The tower's huge bronze double doors appeared magical and had keyholes, and the group decided not to play with them in case of traps.  There were no other visible entrances at low level, but there were some large windows on the top level of the tower, with no glass preventing entry.



Vael dropped his backpack, cast Levitation, and flew up to look in the windows.  He saw a room with a large statue of an 8' tall ibis head in the center, and three relatively recent corpses on the floor, two humans in scale armor with shortswords and one halfling in leather armor that Vael's magery detected as magical.  That was too much loot to ignore, so Vael flew back down to tell the others, then everyone dropped some gear to lighten the load so Vael could cast Levitation on everyone.  Michael was heavy enough that Vael couldn't maintain it on him for long, but he managed to get everyone up into the top floor of the tower.



In addition to the ibis head statue and the corpses, the top floor also featured a couple of wooden stairways down, but only the first few feet of each stairway was visible before things got dark with a suspiciously sharp cutoff.  Also, the wood looked quite rotten, so the stairs might not be safe to descend.  The group ignored the stairs for a bit and searched the room.  They found the magical halfling-sized leather armor, two sets of scale armor, two shortswords, a bandoleer of seven throwing daggers, two scroll cases, and a small golden ornament of a man's head.  They threw all the armor off the tower so they wouldn't have to deal with its weight while Levitating down, took the swords and the bandoleer (but not the daggers), then read the scrolls.  One was a wizard scroll that Vael discerned allowed cursing an item.  The other was a letter from the Archon of Arden Vul to a Thothian high priest, apparently written during the fall of Arden Vul during the civil war 1200 years ago.  They weren't sure about all the details but took the scroll.



Next they closely examined the statue.  It was amazingly constructed of precious materials like silver and ivory, but was somehow still intact.  It also detected as magical.  Uvash warned against damaging it, as it might be a holy item. Vael couldn't resist touching it, and he managed to make it rotate a bit on its vertical axis.  With some help from the stronger Michael, they saw that they could spin the statue all the way around, but nothing happened when they did this.



Finally they investigated the suspiciously dark staircase.  Uvash cast Detect Magic and found that the darkness was magical.  Ashe suspected the darkness probably hid a no mana zone so that anyone Levitating down through it would fall to their death.  The stairs also looked dangerously flimsy.  The combination of the eroded stairs and the magical darkness led the group to decide that exploring the rest of the tower could wait for another day.  For now they would gather their loot and Levitate back down.



Everyone rested at the base of the tower to recover from all the spellcasting, then the group continued north.  They briefly looked at a couple of ruined buildings but didn't investigate in detail.  Due north was a step pyramid, about 90' square and 45' high, the largest intact structure they had seen in the city.  Vael decided to do a lap around the base of the pyramid seeing what was around, while Ioannes looked closely at some artwork on the pyramid's steps.  The first four steps had four different pictures, which then started repeating on the next few steps.  The first was an ibis-headed Thoth pointing both arms at a human descending stairs.  The second was ibis-headed Thoth pointing his left arm at a human, who was bowing while presenting a plate of coins and scrolls.  The third was ibis-headed Thoth puking out a long scroll with abstract writing (no actual words) into the hands of some humans.  The fourth was a baboon seated with a book on its thighs, holding a pen, and gazing at some humans while a feather appeared in the air.  Identifying the baboon as another symbol of Thoth was easy, but naming the feather as the symbol of Thoth's wife Maat required a really good Theology roll by Uvash.  The group decided not to actually ascend the pyramid on this first trip into the ruins.



Meanwhile, Vael had discovered an interesting well to the east of the pyramid.  It was uncovered, about 5' wide, and the insides were covered with mirrors, such that the sun overhead produced blinding reflections that made it hard to see down the well.  Vael couldn't resist dropping a Continual Light rock into the well.  It fell for several seconds, then stopped at the bottom.  It was still making light down there, but the reflections were too blinding to make out any detail.  There were no rungs in the well so the only way down would be Levitation or a long rope.  Vael decided today was not the day to explore the well.



The group decided they had enough loot for their first trip into the ruined city, and headed back for home.  They stopped at the room halfway down the Long Stair and recovered the dwarf-sized mail armor and warhammer they had left there before.  They made it to the bottom with nobody slipping, and then they made it back to Gosterwick without any dangerous encounters.





GM's Comments:



Overall, the group's first trip was a success.  Nobody died or even got hurt.  They made it to the ruins of Arden Vul and back.  They explored a couple of rooms off the Long Stair, a couple of gatehouse towers, and the top floor of the large square tower.  They found the Pyramid of Thoth and the well full of mirrors.  They also found some interesting lore, like the pictures on the pyramid steps, the scroll in the square tower, and the writing on the obelisk.  They found a few things other than portable loot that seemed magic: the colossal statue of Arden, the double doors of the square tower, and the darkness in the stairs of the square tower.  Finally, they scored quite a bit of loot: some big ancient gold coins from the spider tower, some magic boots and weird magic powder and dwarf-sized mail and warhammer from the room off the Long Stair where they burned the webs, and some scale armor and shortswords and halfling-sized magic armor and a spell scroll from the corpses on the top floor of the square tower.



The combat appeared to go smoothly: Michael stuck his head in and found the spiders, then Ashe sent his bat and rat swarms into the tower to kill and distract spiders, and Michael killed the only two spiders that came out of the tower to engage the PCs.  It was actually a closer fight than it looked though.  If Michael had been surprised and attacked by all six spiders, he likely would have died.  With less warning, Ashe's swarms might not have had time to engage the spiders before the spiders bit more PCs.  And of course Michael was the PC who killed two spiders, so if he'd gone down fast that damage would not have happened.  And the spiders were faster than most of the PCs, so running away would not necessarily have been easy.  Sometimes the line between winning without a scratch and a total party kill isn't that big.  Michael's Vision beating the spiders' Stealth was really critical.



Having two clerics means this group doesn't miss Theology rolls to know stuff about religions very often, and most of the party reads Mithric, so the PCs are pretty good at engaging with lore.  Whether the players know what's going on with any of the lore is another question, but it's the first session; they've got plenty of time to piece things together.



The worst part of the session for me was tech issues.  I've used Foundry before but it's been a while, and trying to remember all the exact places to click to fix broken token vision or run a combat is not fun when you've got five live players to deal with.  I did a bunch of map testing with a test token and a non-GM login to test my walls and lights, since sometimes having GM permissions doesn't make it clear that something is broken for regular players, but I forgot to run a full combat to refresh myself on all the battle stuff, so there was some fumbling.  Fortunately these type of issues go away quickly when you use Foundry every week.



What was different in this session because we used DFRPG rather than a version of D&D like Arden Vul was written for?  I'd say the biggest difference was our new PCs had some spells that starting D&D characters would not, and the ability to cast them often rather than once per day if you happened to memorize that spell.  Light was just not an issue with ample Continual Light available, though most of the session was in lit areas so it wasn't a huge deal this time.  (And in D&D Continual Light is only a second level spell and is permanent so any character with a bit of cash should be able to get an NPC to cast it for them.)  Vael's ability to spam Levitation (he has it at 15 so he can levitate people under 160 lbs. pretty cheaply, and even heavier people aren't super expensive if he only needs them to fly for a minute) made getting everyone up to the top of the square tower easy, though this particular use case could be duplicated by one climbing thief in D&D and some rope to help the rest of the party up, or even (with a suitably generous rule set or GM) a rope and grappling hook and the whole party climbing the tower Batman-style.  Another biggie was Ashe's ability to spam Create Animal at the start of the adventure and bring along a bunch of goats and rat and bat swarms; the goats didn't do much except help carry loot home but the swarms took out most of the huge spiders.  Differences in the other direction is that armor is a lot more expensive in DFRPG than in D&D, so these starting characters didn't have much of it.  Though of course they just found some armor and some money, so some of them might be a bit harder to damage next time.  Finally, GURPS has skills for a lot of stuff that old versions of D&D didn't, so things like making Theology rolls for all the ancient religious lore was straightforward.  (D&D added a bunch of skills in 3E so modern D&D is a bit like GURPS there, but AD&D didn't have them yet.)  Since this setting says Mithric is the language of magic, I just told my players that everyone uses Mithric for spellbooks and scrolls and told the spellcasters that if they wanted to be able to read scrolls they should learn Mithric, so they took Mithric, so basically the language that substituted for Read Magic also made reading the Mithric lore easy.



Achievements:

Second Class Citizen: Ashe was the first to play an Imperial Goblin.



Iconic Location: Pyramid of Thoth: The whole party got this achievement for being the first to find the Pyramid of Thoth.



XP:



They haven't identified everything yet, or decided what to keep and what to sell, but 45 gold solidi is worth about 450 modern Archontean gold pieces (they're ten times as heavy), which is $4500.  (All the coin values are house ruled in this game rather than DFRPG stock: basically 
 is a silver piece, and we use AD&D ratios for the other coins.  So a regular gold piece is 
0 and these huge ancient gold pieces are 
00.)  Divided 5 ways, that's $900 each from just the gold, which puts them well into profitable territory.  Nobody used any consumables other than a day of rations, so as 125-point PCs they only need 
56 each (living expenses for a week plus 3 rations) to get their first loot XP.  They need 
560 each (ten times that threshold) to get their second loot XP, and we'll know if they hit it after they identify their treasure and decide what to sell and do the sales math.  Normally PCs in games that lack well-stocked magic item stores avoid selling any magic items because they might want them later, but in this game they might sacrifice items with no immediate use or obvious later importance if it gets them loot XP.  We'll see.



For exploration, the first XP is achievable by visiting at least 5 new areas, and at first glance I think they visted 11.  They didn't visit enough new areas to get the second exploration XP, but they did find the Pyramid of Thoth, which is an Iconic Location, which generated an Achievement for everyone, worth a bonus XP.  So this session was worth at least 3 total XP per player, maybe 4 depending on loot.



Finally, Ashe got the "Second Class Citizen" achievement for being the first to play an Imperial Goblin.  (It's not a bad template, but it's not an obvious choice either.)





Next week:

Presumably the four non-mercenary PCs stick together after their first successful visit to the ruins.  Will they name their party or continue being an anonymous gaggle?  They are expected to bring another permanent PC into the group next week.  Will they go back to the square tower and brave the big bronze doors or the dangerous staircase into magical darkness, climb to the top of the Pyramid of Thoth, go down that mirrored well, or explore more of the surface ruins?  Read next week's recap to find out.

## Full Recap





The Left for Loot or Rich for Riches company decided they needed a mule, so they could haul more stuff up and down the Long Stair.  They went to the Livestock and Horse Merchant in Gosterwick and bought a large mule from Sakeon.  He also sold them a bit and bridle and six saddlebags, but Vale declined the saddle.  They then visited the Grain Hall and bought enough various food to fill the saddlebags.  With their heavily laden mule grudgingly following, they hiked from Gosterwick to the Cliff Face, then up the Long Stair to the ruins of Arden Vul.  From there they continued north and west to the Sign of the Broken Head.  There, they offered Kronos and Estelle a deal: most of the contents of the saddlebags at a reasonable cost.  Kronos out-dealt them and they ended up giving him an even better deal than they intended, but he threw in mule stabling for up to two weeks.





With the mule and most of the food left behind, they decided to visit the baboon tower on the east side of the ruins.  As they approached the tower, the baboons inside responded first with hoots and howls, then with thrown rocks.  Nobody got hit.  Vael cast a Concussion spell that he planned to throw inside the tower to stun some baboons.  Seeing no entrances on the ground level of the tower, just some arrow slits, they decided to climb the partly-ruined city wall to the north and approach the tower from the second level.  A couple of baboons detected their approach and threw more rocks.  By the time they got closer to the tower, there were four baboons throwing rocks through arrow slits from the first floor of the tower and four more throwing rocks down from the roof.  They also heard the much deeper growls of a giant four-armed intelligent baboon inside the tower.





As the party approached the tower, Vael tried throwing his Concussion through an arrow slit.  It was an accurate throw, and a booming noise inside the tower stunned a couple of the large baboons as well as the huge four-armed one, while managing not to stun anyone outside.  Vallium and Michael climbed up the wall, and when they reached the top they were face-to-face with four large baboons.  The baboons mostly continued throwing rocks, but a couple were foolish enough to engage in melee and got aggressively parried.  One baboon bravely tried to slam Vallium off the roof, and rolled a critical hit with excellent damage -- Vallium was knocked off the roof all the way down to ground level, about 30' below.  Luckily for him, the falling damage wasn't too bad and his scale armor absorbed some of it.  





This left Michael on the roof alone fighting four large baboons and the huge one that had just come up the stairs from inside the tower.  Ioannes boosted Uvash up the wall to the roof, them climbed up after him, to help Michael withstand the hooting horde.  Meanwhile, Vael pointed his staff down the side of the wall at Vallium and cast Flight, so that Vallium could rejoin the fight much more quickly.





Michael fought off several baboons, killing one, but took one pretty hard hit from the giant baboon.  Both Uvash and Ioannes cast healing spells on him, while Vallium flew back up to the roof.  A couple more of the large baboons went down, and the giant had one of its four arms crippled.  The larger baboons were having a hard time penetrating Michael and Vallium's armor, and were taking damage from both direct attacks and aggressive parries.





Eventually, as the battle turned against his side, the huge baboon changed tactics and decided to slam Vallium off the roof again.  Unfortunately for him, he missed, and went off the edge himself with a large crash.  He somehow managed to survive the falling damage and even landed on his feet, but Vallium (with the Flight spell still active) chased him down to ground level to finish him off.  Vael first cast a Grease spell under the giant baboon's feet, then a Smoke spell around his head, while Vallium kept stabbing.  Eventually Vallium landed a huge critical hit and knocked the giant baboon unconscious.  The surviving large baboons on the roof and inside the tower fled to the cistern to the east, while Vallium finished off their leader.





The group rested in the tower for a while, then searched it.  The only interesting thing they found were three huge rolled-up tapestries, each about 8'x16' and 100 lbs.  One depicted a battle between wizards and dragon riders.  The second was a multi-panel story about the Fourth Labor of Arden, when she defeated the Berserkers of Westholm.  The final tapestry showed the Seventh Labor of Arden, with Arden and Vul fighting a huge water elemental in a river above a waterfall.  They rolled the tapestries back up, then Vael cast Flight on Vallium again, so he could fly the tapestries back to the Sign of the Broken Head where their mule was.  This was a big production involving three round-trip flights and some Lend Energy spells from Ioannes to help Vael maintain the Flight for several minutes, but it avoided walking.





After more resting to recover from the spellcasting, the group decided to investigate the cistern to the east of the former baboon tower, where they had heard more baboon hooting before.  They spotted an obvious blood trail from the tower to the cistern and then into a tunnel in the side of the cistern, but did not see or hear any baboons.  Everyone climbed down into the cistern.  Michael slipped and suffered some minor falling damage.  Vallium investigated the opening of the tunnel and saw that it was narrow and claustrophobic and continued beyond their light source.





The whole group went down the tunnel, with first Vallium then Uvash in the lead.  There were several side tunnels, but they were all dead ends, so there was one clear path.  There were also a few places where the tunnel widened, but it was very tight most of the way.  It sloped downwards gradually.  After a surprisingly long walk, they heard the sounds of baboon hooting along with some squeaking.  Sneaking ahead, they saw a group of three baboons fighting several giant rats.  They stayed back and let the local wildlife battle, and after the last rat went down, Vallium snuck up behind one of the surviving baboons and stabbed it.  The other one got away.  





The tunnel split into a confusing maze of twisty little passages, some of which diminished to rat size.  Others opened into a huge cave, with a few giant mushrooms and the sound of many many hooting baboons ahead.  There had to be at least dozens of them.  A quick conference ensued, and the group decided to retreat back to the cistern rather than fighting a huge swarm of baboons.  Back at the cistern, Vael cast Shape Earth to plug the tunnel entrance.  It was expensive, because it was worked stone, but his fancy wizard robes helped him draw enough power to successfully cast the spell.  Vallium climbed up the wall of the cistern, then dropped a rope to make the climb easier for the others.  This time, nobody fell.





Thinking about where to go next, Ioannes mentioned there was a tower nearby that they hadn't searched because of a nest of bees.  Vael cast a Windstorm spell centered around the party and used the wind to chase away the bees, and they destroyed the nest.  They searched the ruined tower, but didn't find anything interesting.





Despairing at the lack of loot, Vael cast Seek Earth looking for both gold and silver.  Unfortunately the nearest of both was underground and a bit far.  He then tried Seek Magic, and found some closer to ground level about 50 yards northwest.  The group walked over there and didn't see anything, so he cast Seek Magic a couple more times to triangulate, and decided it had to be under their feet.  There was quite a bit of rubble to dig through, so they walked over to the dam building where they had stored some shovels, and brought those back.  After digging for a while they uncovered a cellar entrance.  The cellar didn't have anything very interesting except a double door to the west and a single door north.  They listened at both doors and heard some scratching sounds to the west.





Vael said he would cast Great Haste on Vallium, and asked both clerics if they wanted to pile on any buffs.  Ioannes cast Flaming Weapon and Uvash cast Shield.  As Vael finished his spell, Michael opened the door, and Vallium rushed in.  There was a group of almost a dozen ghouls and ghasts in there, and Vallium charged in and started chopping them at unreal speed.  Michael and Uvash followed him in, with Uvash pausing a second to invoke Heroic Grace and become supernaturally skilled with his mace.  The fight lasted about five seconds.  Attacking three times per second using the combination of an All-Out Attack (Double) and a regular Attack, Vallium downed most of the undead, with Michael and Uvash each taking down a couple.  Vallium and Uvash each got hit once and briefly stunned by ghoul paralysis, but both quickly recovered.





With the ghouls vanquished, the group searched the cellar and found a copper candelabra and bowls, a heavy round electrum mirror, a couple of potions that looked magical, and a metal shield with the sigil of the Azure Knights that also appeared to be magic.  They took their treasure back to the Broken Head, loaded most of it on their mule, and headed back to Gosterwick.








GM's Comments:





The baboons demonstrated the advantages of terrain and ranged weapons, using the tower and its arrow slits to their advantage.  However, the PCs demonstrated the advantages of armor and weapons versus hide and teeth, as they were able to absorb many attacks from the merely-large baboons without damage, while their own blows tended to badly wound their enemies.  (They were lucky the huge one didn't really connect though, as he was very strong.)








Achievements:





Found the Howling Caves, an Arden Vul Iconic Location








XP:


Exploration: 5 new locations, good for 1 XP


Loot: They didn't find a lot, but the tapestries and electrum mirror were valuable enough for 1 XP


Achievements: 1 XP for an Iconic Location





Next Week:





I haven't heard any concrete plans yet.  There was a bit of the usual discussion about taking down Plumthorn's gang.  They might also try one of the other dungeon entrances they know about, or spend another week exploring the surface ruins.

## Full Recap





Uvash had church and Michael was gone on another hunting trip, so the group felt a bit shorthanded this week, and hired a dwarven mercenary named Thronebreaker from the Grudge Brigade.  Ioannes spent several days taking equine handling lessons from Sakeon the Horse Whisperer, then the group decided to visit the Great Cavern and didn't bring their mule along.  They did grab the leftover food out of the mule's saddlebag and put it in their wheelbarrow, in case they ran into any hungry monsters.  Ioannes rudely dropped the Bless spells he was maintaining on Uvash and Michael, and cast one on Thronebreaker, who had apparently heard from some other mercenary that he could cast it.





The four got up early and hiked from Gosterwick to the Cliff Face, then about two-thirds of the way up the Long Stair to the secret entrance to the Great Cavern.  They found the secret door without problems, and left their wheelbarrow full of food right inside.  They turned left (for loot) and found a cavern containing a padlocked stone chest with the icon of a mailed fist on top.  Vael cast Lockmaster and the lock sprung open, but remained hanging from the chest.  Vael reached out to grab it and the contact poison on the lock seeped right through his gloves and knocked him down.  Fortunately it was not fatal, and Ioannes cast Stop Bleeding while Thronebreaker expressed surprise that a wizard who knew Apportation would ever touch a small object with his bare hands.





Vael stood back up and Apportated the lock off the chest.  Thronebreaker ripped the lid open.  Inside the chest were some rations, torches, javelins, gourd canteens, and flasks of oil.  There was also a leather pouch.  Vael cautiously Apportated the pouch out and flipped it over, and some red mushrooms fell out.  They took the mushrooms and left the rest, figuring they could come back and get it on the way out if they were desperate enough for loot that torches and javelins were worth carrying.





They went back northeast, with Vallium in the lead, until they again saw a statue of a middle-aged man with missing eyes.  They compared the size of the eye holes to the magical silver eye they had found deeper in the dungeon, and concluded that it might fit, but they only had one eye for two eye-holes so they decided to wait until they found another before doing anything.  They continued north to an empty cave, which Thronebreaker investigated with his dwarven Prospecting skill.  He felt some suspicious wind moving through the west wall, and when he tried feeling the wall his hand went right through an illusion.  He stepped through and found a badly burned man sleeping on a bedroll.  The rest of the group crowded in as the man woke up and groaned.  Ioannes cast a Stop Bleeding followed by a Major Healing, which was enough to get the burned man back on his feet.  His name was Klisko, and he said he was a wizard and the sole survivor of a battle to the west.  Some gang of thuggish adventurers had tried to shake down his party in a cavern to the west, and while the heated discussion was ongoing, the thugs' idiot halfling thief had climbed up a statue and attempted to pry out its gem eyes, which caused Massive Fireballs that killed almost everyone in the room.  Klisko had been all the way in the back of the room and so survived the blast, then drank his healing potions and staggered into this cave, where he cast an illusion then went to sleep.





The group had a bunch of questions for Klisko.  The gem-stealing halfling did not appear to match the description of any of the halflings they knew.  His adventuring party did not have a formal name; they had discussed it but not come to a decision.  The leader of his group had been a big fighter named Balthar, with a mustache and a beard.  Yes, he would show them that room, if they could show him a way out.  He said they had been looking for the Tomb of some Sortian named Lycandus, up a wall in the southwest of the Great Cavern, but they had run into a statue door with empty eyes that they could not open, so they had continued south into some room with statues to look for another entrance.





Vael and Ioannes rested for a few minutes while Klisko packed up his bedroll, then Klisko led them west and down a stone staircase into a large room with some decapitated statues lining the north and south walls, a few sarcophagi, a bunch of burned corpses, and a worn statue of some vaguely reptilian creature with multi-faceted amber eyes against the west wall.  Klisko indicated that the reptilian statue was the one the halfling messed with, and the bodies all over the floor were his friends and the thugs that were trying to rob them.  He also pointed to a pile of rocks to the north and said that was the way they came in, but the fireball had triggered a cave-in.  Ioannes felt a sense of unease in the room, like it was dedicated to an evil god.





Thronebreaker walked over to the cave-in and started digging out rocks, then said that it would take days if not weeks of digging to clear the passage.  Vael started looking at the bodies for magic items, and found a couple of potions and a nice long knife, in addition to a non-magical mace and several swords and knives, and a big melted lump of silver.  Ioannes asked if they had opened the sarcophagi, and Klisko said they hadn't started investigating yet when the others came in.  Vael asked if Klisko knew what the silver was, and Klisko thought he remembered one of the bad guys was an evil cleric wearing a silver holy symbol of some kind of dog, so that might be the melted holy symbol.  Klisko asked if they could show him the exit, so they packed up the valuables and walked over to their wheelbarrow near the exit.  Before opening the secret door, Vael asked Klisko not to tell anyone about it.  Klisko agreed, and then walked out the door.  He said he was heading back to Gosterwick to rest.





With Klisko gone, the group left the heavy pile of weapons in the wheelbarrow, and went back to the room with the statues.  Three of the four sarcophagi in the room had already been opened and appeared empty, but the fourth still looked intact.  Thronebreaker used Power Blow for a surge of strength and ripped the lid off.  A skeleton inside the sarcophagus had apparently been waiting a long time for this to happen, and jumped out to attack.  It achieved surprise and managed to lightly wound Thronebreaker with its axe.  A long combat ensued, where the highly skilled skeleton kept parrying and blocking every blow Thronebreaker and Vallium rained upon it, while they parried its axe attacks.  Eventually Thronebreaker got bored with fighting fair and circled behind the skeleton, who did not have  eyes (or even empty eye sockets) on the back of its head.  It could not effectively block attacks it could not see, and they bashed it down until it finally collapsed into a pile of inanimate bones.  The sarcophagus contained a huge ancient octagonal platinum coin, a jade necklace, and a bone scroll case with a magic scroll inside.





Thronebreaker then turned his attention to the statue.  The other three ran to the far side of the room.  Thronebreaker got behind the statue, put his back to the statue and his legs against the wall behind it, used Power Blow, and knocked the statue over.  No fireballs erupted.  The statue was too heavy to bring home, so Thronebreaker decided to decapitate it.  He got Vallium to reluctantly agree to help him roll it so the eyes were facing south away from everyone, then let Vallium run away to safety before he used Power Blow again to decapitate the statue.  Once again no fireballs erupted.  Carefully avoiding contact with the eyes, Thronebreaker picked up the statue's head and carried it to the exit.  When he got near Vael he pretended to throw the head at the wizard, which got the expected reaction.  Instead of throwing it, he carried the head all the way to the wheelbarrow, and set it under the wheelbarrow, hoping that would help shelter the other loot if someone set the trap off.





With the evil temple explored, the party headed back east through various passages they knew led back to the Great Cavern.  They briefly discussed flying up a rock formation that had a hole into the depths they had not yet explored, but eventually decided to leave that for another day.  Instead they went into a cave entrance to the northeast.  They found a baboon head impaled on a spear.  Undeterred, they continued and saw a magical pillar of fire to the east.  To the north, they saw three small fire elementals of some sort, wearing outlandish costumes with purple jackets and orange top hats, and smoking some kind of mushroom cigars.  The fire creatures babbled at them in some language they did not know.  Eventually, one of them threw the almost-spent butt of its mushroom cigar at Vallium.  Vallium picked it up and tried it, which caused him to get a lot dumber and a bit more perceptive.  





While the fire creatures laughed, the group left and went southeast through some more unexplored passages.  They found the decomposing body of what appeared to be an elven woman.  While Ioannes was investigating for signs of death, he spotted a cat hiding in the corner.  He fed some of his rations to the cat, which caused three more cats to come out of hiding and share the feast.  The elf had a magical staff and a pouch with some gems, which Vael took.  They left the cats, but Ioannes resolved to come back for them later.





As Vallium slowly recovered his wits, the group walked north to the shore of the underground lake.  There was still a skiff sitting on the southern dock, so they tried the magic fish-shaped rod that allegedly controlled boats.  This had no effect.  Several people tried the rod in case someone else was doing it wrong, but they eventually concluded that this rod did not work on this boat.  Vael stated that he had no confidence in this boat and would prefer to fly over the water.  He cast Flight on the two heavier fighters and Levitation on the two lighter casters and the four of them flew over the water and up the crystal cavern they had earlier spotted on the west cavern wall above the lake.





Entering the cavern, Thronebreaker identified the crystals as selenite.  Two man-sized creatures made of selenite crystals emerged from the other crystals and started speaking an unknown rock-clickly language, then gesturing at the party.  Apparently meat-people and crystal-people do not use a common form of gestures, as the party had no idea what their gestures meant.  The main gesture was pointing both elbows downward rapidly, which escalated into smashing both into the floor, but the party failed to understand.  Thronebreaker got bored with the communication failures and advanced into the room, trying to intimidate the crystal creatures out of his way.  This worked for a while, but eventually one attacked him.  It missed, but he kept pressing, and eventually a full fight broke out.  The crystal guardians were quite tough, and appeared to regenerate when damaged, but there were only two of them, and Vael cast Great Haste on Vallium, and eventually they were worn down and smashed.  Thronebreaker thought the crystals might have some value, so Vael took some crystals, from the creatures' bodies and from the walls of the cavern.





Continuing to the northwest, they found a humid cave full of giant mushrooms.  These ones were brown, so did not sound like the Cloud Caps the beastmen were seeking.  There was an exit to the southwest, and when Thronebreaker approached it he heard yelling in another unknown language, from what looked like a walking giant mushroom.  There were several more in the cavern to the southwest, in various sizes and colors, and they were approaching with apparent hostility.  Thronebreaker tried his Intimidation skill to scare them off, and was intimidating enough that the mushrooms stopped in their cave and yelled, rather than continuing to advance.  After eyeballing the mushrooms for a while, the group left to the northwest, toward the sound of moving water.





They found a warm, sandy cave, with a pool in the northeast corner and an underground river to the north, flowing west to east toward the lake.  They decided not to cross the water, and went back to the humid cave.  They took another exit to the northwest, crossed under the river, and saw a magic staff stuck into the sand, glowing brightly blue.  Vael looked at it suspiciously, used Apportation to pick it up, then reluctantly touched it.  He set it back down, relieved to find that it was not obviously cursed.  At that point he was juggling 3 staffs: his own, this glowing blue one, and the one from the dead elf near the cats.  He lashed two of them to his backpack.





The group continued north then southeast then southwest, and heard the sound of a bunch of rats.  Vallium investigated and saw rats fleeing into various small crevices.  They had been eating some dead pile of translucent goo.  Mixed into the goo were a few copper coins and what looked like a single magic bracer.  Vael could not ignore the lure of magic so used Apportation to extract the bracer from the goo, then carry it south to the stream, then wash it.  When it looked reasonably goo-free he put it in his backpack.





To the east was a cave with 3 stalagmites, and no stalactites above them.  Thronebreaker suggested that Vael fly up and check the ceiling.  Vael did so and found nothing suspicious.  He used Shape Earth to break one stalagmite and found nothing interesting.  Stumped, he sat down and cast Seek Magic, then Seek Earth for gold.  There was some magic to the southwest, and some gold in this room, under one of the other stalagmites.  Using another Shape Earth he broke it open and recovered a gold ring.  Another casting of Seek Earth found some more gold only a few yards north, so they went that way.





North then northeast through a very narrow corridor was a cave with a giant lizard, guarding a nest.  The lizard was too big to fit through the narrow corridor, which gave the party time to cast Great Haste and Shield spells on Vallium.  Fully buffed, he ran into the room at high speed and started rapidly stabbing the lizard.  Meanwhile, Thronebreaker squeezed through the passage and began attacking at a more normal pace.  Vallium grievously wounded it several times, knocking it down and stunning it, and then Thronebreaker decided to finish it with an all-out attack to the skull with Power Blow.  He split its skull open and destroyed its brain.  The nest contained a couple of giant lizard eggs and one egg made of gold; the group grabbed all three.  There was a suspicious dead end passage to the northeast, so Thronebreaker searched for a secret door in the obvious place and found one.  It opened into the northern end of the Great Cavern, near a beastman observation cage  Vael then suggested that Ioannes try skinning the lizard in case some part of it was valuable.  While Ioannes did that, another giant lizard approached from the northwest, but Thronebreaker intimidated it away.





At this point they were back in the Great Cavern and had some loot, so they decided to go back home.  Vael cast Levitation or Flight on everyone to get them back over the lake.  Ioannes went back to the cave to retrieve the four cats, lured out with lizard meat.  The black cat that seemed to be the leader decided they should all follow the human as long as he kept feeding them, and the other three scared cats followed.





They walked back to the secret door and found their wheelbarrow full of loot and trapped statue head still there.  They put the trapped statue head in a sack to make sure nobody touched the eyes, put the sack in the wheelbarrow, and went back to Gosterwick.








GM's Comments:





Running the Great Cavern is exhausting.  So many locations, so many weird monsters.  Also lots of twisty little passages that sometimes get the player tokens stuck.  I imagine it would be very difficult to map, if not using a VTT.  (My players aren't actually mapping in real life.  I just let them use Foundry's map memory if any of the PCs is mapping in-game, so they do that.)





I was impressed that the PCs avoided robbing Klisko.  They looted all the corpses of his friends and enemies, but showed him the way out as agreed, and didn't even rob him on the way out.





Hilariously, the adventure did not list a value for the statue's amber eyes.  I guess Richard Barton figured that Obvious Mega Fireball Trap That Just Caused a Rare Simultaneous Almost Double TPK Plus Cave-In would be enough to deter all PCs.  He was of course wrong; there is no course of action so obviously dumb that some PC won't try it.  I rolled a random value for the amber eyes, using the values of all the other amber gems in the adventure to establish a range.  (Did you know that "amber" is contained in "chamber", and that PDF viewers without a whole-words-only search option are annoying?  Now you do!)





One of the players noted that the trapped statue head would make an excellent gift for their favorite halflings under the pyramid.  If the eyes had been very valuable and easy to safely remove then I think greed would have prevailed, but it turns out they're not super valuable and not at all easy to safely remove, so we will probably see this play out in a future session, whenever they decide they're ready to fight Plumthorn's halfling gang.





Having Intimidation at a high level is surprisingly effective, at least when the GM allows using it.  For creatures whose reactions are not predetermined, scaring them can sometimes be just as effective as killing them, and a lot faster.  Of course if there are drawbacks: you don't get their stuff, and they're still there when you return.








Achievements:





None








XP:


Exploration: 13 new locations, good for 1 XP


Loot: Lots, with the most valuable item being a magic long knife.  Enough for 2 XP if enough is sold.


Achievements: None


Total: 3 XP








Next Week:





I think they might actually take a shot at Plumthorn's halflings, if they get a full party.  The lure of Chekhov's Statue Head might be too much to resist.

## Full Recap





Ioannes and Thronebreaker adopted the four cats found in the Great Cavern the previous week.  Ioannes paid Fael the druid to cast Beast Speech and speak to the black cat who appeared to be the leader.  He explained that his name was Onyx, that he used to be the familiar of an Elven mage named Lyra, and that Lyra had been killed by a giant lizard while foolishly adventuring without sufficient bodyguards.  He had met the other cats while looking for a way out the Great Cavern, and had survived by adopting their primitive lifestyle of eating mice and small lizards and sleeping in a damp cave, but he didn't like it at all.  He had been trying to find a way out, so they could find a nice wizard to adopt them and provide a civilized existence, but had not yet succeeded until Ioannes and his bodyguards had found them.  He asked Fael if he could be placed with a female elven wizard who was smart enough not to go adventuring, as having his previous wizard killed had been stressful.  Fael smiled and relayed Onyx's message and returned him to Ioannes, who then took the cats back to his apartment at the Arcane Practitioners' Club.





After a brief discussion about whether it was time to kill Plumthorn's halflings the Left for Loot club decided to instead continue exploring the Great Cavern.  They threw away their two-week-old supply of trade food and bought a wheelbarrow full of new food, then pushed it back to the secret entrance two-thirds of the way up the Long Stair.  Leaving the wheelbarrow inside the entrance, they first checked the stone supply chest nearby, but it appeared nobody else had disturbed it in the past week.  Vallium then led them through a series of small cave passages until they emerged into the Great Cavern, full of giant mushrooms.  They walked north to the shore of the lake and then west to the dock, and discussed whether they should take a boat north or fly.  Ioannes mentioned that they hadn't fully explored the southwest corner of the cavern yet, so they followed a path southwest from the dock.





The path eventually revealed a constructed platform about twenty-five feet up the west wall of the cavern, with several humans standing on it, wearing red scale armor and holding crossbows.  The guards told them to go away or get shot.  The party did not want to go away, so the lead arbalist took a shot at Vael, at the same time Vael started casting Missile Shield on himself.  The crossbowman was a bit faster than the caster, and the bolt almost plugged Vael in the chest, but then his Bless spell intervened and made it slightly miss.  Vael did not lose his spell, finished making himself immune to missiles, and then did his best impersonation of a wizard about to cast Fireball in an attempt to draw more shots at himself.





Vael actually cast Flight on Vallium, while the other three crossbowmen took aimed shots at his companions.  None of them got past a shield and actually hurt anyone.  While they reloaded, Vallium flew up and started stabbing one of them, while Michael winged his boomerang at another one.  Meanwhile Uvash ran forward under the platform hoping Vallium would kick down a rope ladder to him, and Ioannes cast Shield on Michael.





Around the time the guards loosed their second bolts, Vael had cast Flight on Michael, who started flying up to join the melee.  Vallium tried kicking the rope ladder down to Uvash while fighting, but failed to do both at once, so Uvash was still standing below in frustration.  The guards dropped their crossbows after their second shots and pulled out maces, but did not have time to ready their nearby shields, so they did not fight very effectively.  Vallium and Michael eventually wounded a couple of them.  By then Vael had noticed Uvash's frustration and cast an Apportation spell to lower the rope ladder.  Uvash climbed up it, with Ioannes behind him.  By the time they reached the top, Michael and Vallium had knocked out three of the guards, with the fourth running down a finished stone passage to the west, carved into the side of the Great Cavern.  With Flight spells still going, Vallium and Michael were both much faster than the wounded fleeing guard.  Vallium cut him badly, and then Michael landed a critical hit and finished him off.





Uvash and Ioannes noticed that, in addition to the red scale armor, one of the guards was wearing a holy symbol of a dog with square ears, a distinct symbol of the proscribed Cult of Set.  After a quick discussion of whether they wanted to take prisoners, the party decided they couldn't afford to leave any Set guards alive, and threw all four off the platform back into the Great Cavern to finish them off and to make it easier to collect their armor.  Michael flew down to strip off their armor, while Vallium stood guard and Vael and Ioannes rested.





The group continued west until the stone passage opened into a storeroom, with sacks lining two walls and a closed door to the west.  They searched all the sacks and mostly found dried mushrooms, though Vael also found a silver plate engraved with a sheep's head.  They took the silver and left the mushrooms, then opened the door and continued west.  They next found a surprisingly nice room, full of comfortable furniture, and with a fire still burning in the fireplace, but with nobody present.  They didn't find any very portable valuables, so they listened to the door to the north.  Hearing nothing, Vallium tried to open it, but it was locked.  Vael Lockmastered it open, and then they went north, down a finished tunnel that turned into a rougher cave tunnel descending to the north.  It ended at a junction, with a door leading north, a caved-in passage to the west, and a very narrow passage northeast.  After checking the cave-in and deciding it was impassable, they went northeast.





Vallium, in the lead, decided to follow the right-hand wall.  This led them to a passage south, into a room whose walls were covered with some softly growing green stuff.  After some discussion, Vael took a sample of the green stuff and put it in a flask for later investigation.  They went north, then southeast, then a passage dead-ended into two lobes, each with a pillar.  The pillars were identical stone pedestals with onyx columns on top, each of which was divided into five sections with various animal faces carved into them, pierced by vertical metal rods like kebabs.  The each section had the same five animals: a snake, a cat, a lizard, a ram, and a winged horse.  It was possible to spin each section.  Uvash recognized this as some kind of combination puzzle, and Ioannes and Vael confirmed that the columns were magical.  Neither of the clerics could think of any theological connection between the five animals, and nobody wanted to start trying random combinations, so they decided to leave the pillars until they found more information.





Continuing to follow the right wall in the twisty maze of cavern tunnels, Vallium led the group into a large cavern with a high ceiling.  While walking through the middle of the cavern, Vallium was surprised by something invisible punching him in the head.  It didn't hit hard enough to hurt him through his helmet and Ring of Protection, but it didn't appear after attacking either.  Vallium tried stabbing the general area where the blow had come from.  He occasionally made soft contact, but the attacker didn't feel very solid, so his sword blows didn't seem to cause as much damage as usual.  Meanwhile his allies looked around trying to find the invisible creature.  At one point Michael though he got a solid fix on its location and chucked his boomerang at it, but to no obvious effect.  Vael decided some area effect magic was in order, so cast Create Fire where he thought the thing was, then Shape Fire to try to move the fire wherever Vallium's sword blows led him.  Eventually the combination of several sword blows and the fire made the thing stop attacking, but they never found a body.





They left the room to the northeast, into a room where two lizardmen were standing with their hands up in a sign of peace.  The lizardmen said something in a hissing language that was presumably Lizardman, and the party responded in various human and elf and dwarf languages, but there was no common language.  Fortunately Ioannes knew Gift of Tongues, and he cast it go gain temporary mastery of Lizardman.  It turned out the lizardmen were lost; they had come up from two levels below, were lost, and could not find their way back to the way they came up, or to the Great Cavern.  Asked why they were here, they first asked if the party were friends with the Settites.  When Ioannes said they didn't like the Settites, the lizardmen revealed that they were here to kill some Settites who had killed some lizardmen.  Their names were Skizz and Burzip.  Ioannes said he could give them directions to the Great Cavern if they didn't mess with their loot and put in a good word with the other lizardmen.  Skizz readily agreed, and the two lizardmen departed, trying to follow Ioannes' directions.





Searching the cave, Vael noticed a magical glyph on the wall in the southwest corner.  He didn't recognize it, and so asked the others if they would give him enough time to cast Analyze Magic.  He did, and found that the glyph protected from wetness and had additional powers.  He cast another Analyze magic and found that it also protected from detection, including scrying.  At that point he was suspicious that someone was using the glyph to hide, but they didn't find anyone.  After some rest, they resumed exploring.





They went northeast, into a cave full of mushrooms.  One of the mushrooms started emitting a high-pitched squeal.  They quickly decided that the noise would give them away and possibly attract trouble, so they turned around and went west.  They entered a cave full of thick white mist.  Vallium didn't like the mist and asked Vael to cast Purify Air.  He cleared the mist, at which point they saw a few exits.  One of them formed a loop back toward the shrieking mushrooms.





Another exit led to a hot room with a bunch of hot mud on the floor.  Someone was immediately concerned that there might be mudmen, so everyone was on guard.  Nobody had a 6-foot, 10-foot, or 11-foot pole, so Vael used his Wizard's Staff to poke the mud while hiding behind Vallium.  That was enough to annoy a mud person, who popped out of the mud and punched Vallium.  The attack was ineffective, and Vallium stabbed it for its affront.  A brief fight started, where that mud person fought Vallium while two more mud people stayed back in the mud and lobbed hot mud balls.  Someone said that mud people were unlikely to have treasure so this fight was stupid and they should all leave.  Most of the group started retreating, but Uvash missed the message and attacked the wounded mud person, and it looked like Uvash might get mobbed by all three mud people.  Fortunately his friends noticed that he was lagging behind and waited for him, and he eventually.  With one of the mud people almost dead, they did not pursue the group out of their muddy cave.





Left for Loot decided that was enough adventuring for the day, and retraced their steps back to the Great Cavern.  The corpses of Set guards were still there, along with their armor and weapons.  They took all the armor and weapons back to their wheelbarrow inside the secret door, then brought it all back to Gosterwick, where they would attempt to sell it without revealing themselves to the Set cult.








GM's Comments:





Running this part of the adventure is still hard, as it's a bunch of little caves connected by a bunch of little winding tunnels and I'm never sure exactly which way the group is headed or what they're about to meet until I check the room description.  They had five different encounters in this session but negotiated with the lizardmen and ran away from the shriekers without a fight, and from the mud people after a brief fight.





This was the first contact with the Cult of Set, which they'd heard a bit about.  It was also their first contact with lizardmen, who they hadn't heard anything about yet.  So they are continuing to expand their knowledge of the Halls and their map, even in sessions where they don't make much obvious progress.





The combination of altitude and superior ranged weapons is a great advantage, but for the second time in this campaign we've seen that Flight spells are a great counter.








Achievements:





None








XP:


Exploration: 10 new locations, good for 1 XP


Loot: Just the Set guards' armor and weapons and that one silver plaque, but good for 1 XP


Achievements: None


Total: 2 XP








Next Week:





A couple of players will be unavailable, so the others are unlikely to feel strong enough to take a run at the halflings.  I suspect they'll continue exploring the Great Cavern area, or the surface ruins.

## Full Recap

Most of the Left for Loot (alias Right for Riches) company decided to take a shopping trip to Newmarket, but Ioannes didn't want to spend that long away from his newly acquired cats, so he stayed in Gosterwick.  And then he got bored so he went over to the Grudge Brigade Mercenary HQ and hired both the animal summoning goblin druid "Goat" and the mysterious half-elven staff fighter "Chrysalis".  Crysalis had just bought a Staff of Blue Light that Left for Loot had found in the Great Cavern, and wanted to test it out.  Ioannis told them that with a small group he didn't want to go all the way up the Long Stair into the ruins of Arden Vul, just go to the base of the waterfall and check out the old haunted watchtower and the tunnels that Goat had previously found behind the waterfall's plunge pool using a Water Vision spell.  The mercs were fine with that, as long as they got paid.

Ioannes dropped the Bless spells on his usual companions, figuring they couldn't get in too much trouble shopping, and Blessed both Goat and Chrysalis.  He also made a couple of new Continual Light rocks.  Chrysalis cast Keen Hearing on all three of them, saying she could maintain it all day.  Goat summoned two more goats (in addition to Camilla) and offered to let the goats carry everyone's backpacks.  He also summoned some bat swarms, but those didn't carry anything.

The group headed north on the Imperial Road toward Arden Vul, and ran into a group of 6 adventurers heading the other way.  The leader of the other company, a big Thorcin fighter, introduced himself as Hama and also mentioned the names of his companions.  Ioannes introduced himself as Ioannes, from Right for Riches.  Hama asked if there was news from Gosterwick, and Ioannes didn't have anything major to report.  Ioannes asked Hama for news from Arden Vul and was told the halflings under the pyramid were doing a major construction project, building new doors around the Glory of Thoth.

After bidding Hama and Company farewell, the party and the world's worst traveling petting zoo continued north until they approached the waterfall.  Their plan was to fight the terrifying ghost they had fled from before, but with some new spells to give them a better chance.  Ioannes cast Bravery on everyone to defeat the ghost's fear attack, and planned to later cast Affect Spirits on their weapons (including a goat) so they could actually hurt it.  They crept toward the watchtower, but the ghost didn't show himself.  Goat started casting Mystic Mist to make the battlefield unfair in their favor, and when he was almost done, Ioannes cast Affect Spirits on Chrysalis's blue staff, then Chrysalis ran forward and opened the trap door leading to the basement.

That caused the Yrtol the Unfriendly Ghost to emerge from the basement, just like last time, screeching a fearful threat to kill all Settites.  This time, with the Bravery spell up, none of them were scared.  Yrtol pointed his Finger of Doom at Chrysalis, but she was close enough to parry the attack with her glowing blue staff, and the purple doom-beam missed her harmlessly.  She gave the ghost a good smack.  As Yrtol felt the pain of a weapon that could actually hurt him, wielded by someone who could parry his attacks and seemed immune to his fear, he retreated back into the wall of the tower.  Chrysalis hit him one more time before he fully disappeared into the wall, and they did not see the ghost again.  He yelled some more threats about how he would kill them all since they were Settite murderers, and Ioannes yelled something back about not being Settites and in fact killing Settites, but they did not see him again and so could not be sure if he heard them through the stone wall he was cowering inside of or behind.

With the ghost apparently fled, Goat finished casting Mystic Mist to protect them while they searched, and then Chrysalis went down into the basement.  It was a 20' square room, mostly featureless, but with a skeleton on the floor.  The skeleton was wearing a tarnished silver circlet and a silk purse.  Afraid to touch anything, Ioannes asked Goat to have a goat open the purse.  Inside were a magic potion and a magic pebble.  Ioannes took a close look at the potion and thought it looked like a Flight potion, worth serious money.  They had no idea about the pebble but took it anyway, and they took the purse too.  The circlet did not appear magical, but it was valuable (if silver) or very valuable (if platinum), so of course they took it too.  They searched the basement for secret doors, didn't find any, and left with Yrtol's stuff before the ghost returned.

Next they headed to the waterfall's plunge pool.  Goat cast Water Vision and again noted the location of two tunnels, about 35' and 40' underwater, behind the waterfall.  After some discussion he cast Water Vision, Breathe Water, and Swim on Chrysalis.  Chrysalis swam through the eastern tunnel, with a strong current at her back, and eventually popped up into a large cave, with huge statue of Arden's head on the north wall, and a huge snapping turtle swimming toward her.  She backed into the tunnel that she thought was too narrow for it to follow, then parried its bite and smacked it in the flipper.  She followed up with a hard blow to the head, momentarily stunning the huge turtle.  It regained its wits and came at her again, then reconsidered and swam away.

Meanwhile, Goat got a bit worried and summoned a swarm of fish and a poisonous water snake, sending them down the tunnel after Chyrsalis and ordering them to protect her.  However they arrived right as she drove the turtle away, so merely served as an honor guard.  She swam around the cave a bit, seeing a small dry platform to the south and a larger one to the west, then swam back out to update her friends.

Goat was tired from casting and maintaining so many spells, and Ioannes was casting Lend Energy to help, when Chrysalis popped out of the water.  She let them know about the cave and the turtle, and said she would wait for them inside.  She then swam back into the cave and climbed up onto the southern dry platform, where she could probably be safe from drowning, current, and giant turtles until the others arrived.  There was an old campfire and a skeleton there, but no loot.  She searched the platform while waiting for the others, but didn't find anything.

After some rest, Goat cast Breathe Water on both himself and Ioannes, and Swim and Water Vision on Ioannes, then climbed on the larger Ioannes's back while Ioannes swam quickly down the tunnel, into the cave, past Chrysalis on the south platform, and up a flight of stairs to the west platform.  He dropped Goat off there, then swam back and grabbed Chrysalis and swam her over to the west platform too.  Ioannes was pretty fresh after the short magically-enhanced swim, but Goat was tired from casting all those spells, so took another rest.

Ioannes and Chrysalis searched the west platform.  There was an inscription on the wall in Mithric, which he could read (but not fluently).  It said something like "Let all persons honor the sacrifice of Arden, founder of this site and defender of her people" in huge letters, and "Lucullus Axia made this as thanks to Lady Arden for rescuing him" in merely big letters.  There were also a couple of old clay lamps and a couple of old silver coins.

With Water Vision still running, Chyrsalis scanned the bottom of the pool and spotted what looked like a magic shield on the bottom.  She got Goat to cast another Swim spell on her, but thought she could do the dive without Water Breathing.  She used Breath Control, then dove toward the shield.  On the way, she spotted another glint of magic, so moved that way and grabbed a magical red square of glass.  She then swam over and grabbed the shield, then surfaced.  The turtle had not reappeared.

While the Swim spell was still active, she jumped back in the water and looked around.  She saw two staircases on the north wall, flanking the statue of Arden, starting about 20' underwater.  She surfaced, told the others that she was going to explore the stairs, then took a big breath and dove.  With the Swim spell she quickly emerged from the top of the stairs into a dry passage with breathable air, with passages leading north and west.  She looked around quickly, then swam back south before the Swim spell ran out to tell the others, then swam back north again to wait for them at the top of the stairs.

Eventually Goat had enough energy back to cast Swim on Ioannes and Water Breathing on both of them, and Ioannes carried him up the watery stairs toward Chrysalis.  Once they were all reunited on dry land, Goat dropped all the aquatic spells and summoned some new goats and bat swarms.  Chrysalis heard the sound of bare feet running to the north.  When the animals were all ready, the group headed north, then turned east, then saw an open doorway to the south and smelled a horrible odor coming from that direction.  Looking into the room, they saw skeletons, graffiti on the walls, piles of filth everywhere, and a skinny dirty woman wearing rags and a gigantic magical-looking belt, squatting on a table.  She babbled various unfriendly things.  Ioannes tried talking to the woman, but she accused him of being in league with the demon turtle.  He mentioned food, which seemed to interest her, but they had left most of their gear outside guarded by the goats, so they didn't actually have any.  She hid behind the table.  Eventually they gave up on talking to her and left.

They continued down a passage east, then south, then east into a room containing some stone benches, a shrine to Arden, and a circular pool that appeared magical.  There was a Mithric inscription on the wall saying "Those who would take up the labors of the Great Defender must purify themselves."  Ioannes washed his hands in the pool, and the water felt clean.  Everyone wondered why the woman was so dirty if she had this pool of clean water right here.  There were some offerings to Arden on the shrine, including a couple of small ivory statuettes, but Ioannes thought it would be wrong to take them.

They went north up a staircase and found a makeshift barricade with the corpses of about a dozen ancient legionaires heaped all over it.  The ancient equipment was all in bad shape, but the bodies had a few ancient gold solidi and silver coins, so they took those.  There were doors leading north and east beyond the barricade.  They listened at both, but Ioannes said they should go back west and investigate their route back before opening these doors.

Going back west, they spotted the crazy woman spying on them around a corner, but she fled.  They went west to where they had emerged from the water, then continued farther west, into a room with more ancient corpses.  They had a few usable-looking shortswords and spears.  Ioannes declared that the shortswords were valuable loot and took them, but they left the spears.  There was a closed door south, and a big archway east, with orange light coming through it.

They went through the archway into a huge and splendid room.  It contained frescoes all about the Labors of Arden on the north and south walls, as well as twelve magical pillars with magical Mithric numerals on them, one dedicated to each of the Labors of Arden.  There was a sunken circular area in the center of the long room, containing a relatively recent corpse of a knight in magical scale armor, with a magic greatsword next to him.  Everyone was suspicious of the sunken area, so they all left the room, then sent in a summoned goat to get the loot.  It pushed first the sword, then the knight's corpse, all the way from the sunken area to the stairs on the west side of the room.  While the corpse was being dragged, a purse fell off its belt.  Chrysalis ran over and grabbed it, and it contained a bunch of small pink gems.  Ioannes inspected the corpse.  He appeared to be a Knight of the Azure Shield, probably only weeks or months old, and had fatal puncture wounds all around its neck, like he had been repeatedly stabbed in the neck by spears or daggers.

Ioannes picked up the sword, which briefly felt like it resisted being picked up, then yielded, then sent a vision into Ioannes' head.  The sword was being held by the knight, as it was plunged over and over into a bear-sized creature with feathers like a bird.  It struck the killing blow, and the knight rested -- as another of the creatures snuck up behind him and grabbed him by the neck with its huge horrible claws, and squeezed and stabbed and strangled, while the knight swung the sword blindly back trying to fend off the attack.  The vision ended with the sword falling from the knight's hands and then the knight falling to the ground next to it.

They discussed stripping the armor off the body, then decided to leave it on and just take the whole corpse out.  They checked the door to the south, but it was locked, and they didn't have any lockpicks, and decided not to try to break it down.  They investigated to the east of the big room, and found some stairs leading up to another room with four more ancient bodies.  One body had a magic shortsword, and there was a well-preserved deluxe folio of The Twelve Labors of Arden nearby.  The other weapons and armor were in bad condition.

At that point Ioannes said they had enough treasure and should head back.  They went back to the crazy woman's room and tried to convince her to come with them, but she just laughed at the idea and screamed at them to leave her alone.  Eventually they gave up and went back to the watery stairs.  Goat first cast his aquatic spells on Chrysalis, who scouted ahead, didn't see the turtle in the big watery cave, eventually found that it was resting in a side cavern to the east, decided not to fight it, and went back to report to the others that the western tunnel looked like a safe way out.  She then swam out of the cave before the spells expired to wait for the others, dragging the knight's corpse behind her.  Goat rested a bit, then cast Breathe Water on himself and Ioannes, Swim on Ioannes, and Shape Water to create an air bubble to protect the book.  Ioannes swam both of them out.

When they met Chrysalis at the edge of the plunge pool, they took the magic scale armor off the knight's corpse, then buried the body.  Goat then said to hold on for a moment, grabbed all the food out of his backpack, and summoned a (merely large, not dire) turtle.  Chrysalis tied the food to the turtle's shell and Goat ordered the turtle to carry the food up the tunnel, across the wet cave, up the submerged stairs, and north to the dry area where the woman could find it.

They headed back to Gosterwick with a large amount of treasure to split three ways.  They didn't run into anything significant on the way.


GM's Comments:

Ghosts are a lot less scary (literally) when you have a Bravery spell.  And having an Affect Spirits spell helps too.  Yrtol the Unfriendly Ghost took a couple of hard smacks from Chrysalis's glowing blue staff and noped his way through a wall.

I fully expected the PCs to cast Breathe Water and Swim on a single scout (because Goat didn't have enough FP to cast them on everyone at once) and send them into the cave alone, which they did.  I wasn't sure if that one PC would survive the experience, as the turtle was SM +4 (bigger than an elephant) with the bite damage to match.  One good surprise roll followed by one good bite could be the last thing that scout never saw.  However Chrysalis had Water Vision, which nerfed the turtle's otherwise excellent chance of surprise, and without surprise she was able to parry its bite and then land a nice brain shot (she initially rolled poor damage, but used Luck to reroll) to stun it.  At that point it decided to go hide and wait for easier prey.

These players are definitely motivated by XP.  At some point they decided they had explored enough rooms and found enough treasure to meet their weekly quota of both, and decided it was time to go home.


XP:

Exploration: 9 new locations, good for 1 XP
Loot: A very good haul, and only split 3 ways (summoned animals don't get paid), for 2 XP
Achievements: None
Total: 3 XP


Next Week:

Most of Left for Loot should be back from Newmarket and will probably be jealous of all the stuff Ioannes and the mercenaries found.  I suspect that they'll want to revisit the area behind the falls, since they left some unopened doors and a mysterious woman behind.  Of course that will only happen if Goat is available again, as he's currently their only source of Breathe Water and Swim.

## Full Recap

Vallium and Uvash took a week-long trip to Newmarket.  While there, Vallium saw the town and did some carousing for rumors.  Uvash met the Priest of Zodarrim, Gedric Malachite, who warned him to be wary of dopplegangers.  When they returned, Ioannes told them about the trip he had taken with a couple of the Grudge Brigade mercenaries, behind the plunge pool of the waterfall beneath the Cliff Face leading to Arden Vul.  They decided to revisit the area behind the waterfall, to try to kill the giant turtle that had attacked them and rescue the starving crazy woman they had met there.

Getting behind the waterfall safely required some swimming or fish summoning magic, so they hired GOAT the druid again.  GOAT was very interested in getting a good look at the giant turtle, to see if he could summon more like it.  They also brought along Basilisk, the tiny halfling martial artist.  The night before leaving, Ioannes Blessed everyone and made some Continual Light rocks.  They headed out toward the waterfall early on Demmasday morning.  When the reached the vicinity of the waterfall, Vallium and GOAT spotted some lizardmen climbing down the cliffs west of the waterfall, but they were too high up to be a threat.

GOAT summoned three large manta rays to tow people underwater, and cast Swim on Uvash and Water Vision on Vallium.  Vallium was wearing a Ring of Free Action, which allowed him to pass through the water unnaturally quickly.  Everyone went quickly underwater through the western tunnel behind the waterfall, and emerged in the underground grotto.  The giant turtle was nowhere to be seen, so Vallium went to the side cave to the east and, with his Water Vision, saw the giant turtle there, at the limit of his Continual Light.  The turtle saw Vallium's light at the same time, and charged at him with its mouth open.

A furious fight ensued at the surface of the water.  Vallium fought the turtle while swimming.  He parried its bite and it retreated and dodged his attempt to stab its huge eye.  Meanwhile Basilisk jumped off a manta ray onto the wall of the cavern, where she clung while making repeated stunning kiai screams at the turtle.  Another manta ray charged at the turtle and tried hitting it with its tail barb, but failed to penetrate the tough hide on its flippers.

The battle was a standstill for several seconds, with Basilisk repeatedly stunning the turtle and preventing it from attacking, then the turtle shaking off the stun and managing to dodge Vallium's blows.  Finally Basilisk unleashed a particularly vicious kiai that stunned the turtle for a longer duration, and Vallium managed to stab it deeply through the eye and into the brain.  This was not quite enough to kill the huge turtle, but it did knock it unconscous, and Vallium fatally stabbed before it could recover, and then stabbed it several more times just to be sure.  After it was dead, the GOAT inspected the remains of the turtle, and sadly decided it was some kind of magical dire animal rather than just a large natural animal, so he did not have the power to create more like it.

With help from the manta rays, the group pushed the huge corpse of the turtle west toward the huge statue of Arden and the underwater stairs heading north.  During the operation, Ioannes spotted something on the bottom that he thought might be magic, so he asked Vallium to dive for it.  Vallium pulled up a brooch.  At that point they decided it would make sense to search the whole grotto for valuables.  The Swim spell had expired, so the others rested on relatively dry land while Vallium swam around with the help of his magic ring and Ioannes let a manta ray tow him while he looked for magic items.  They ended up pulling up a silver scroll case, a shortsword tightly wrapped in a bear skin, a small statue of a discus thrower, two small silver tokens with Arden on one side and "Now she must be defended" in Mithric on the other, a small pot of silver coins, a helmet, and an ivory coffer with some candles inside.  Eventually they didn't find any more treasure for a while, and decided it was time to proceed north up the stairs.

The rays towed the group underwater and up the stairs until they emerged into breathable air.  The GOAT had a hard time maintaining the large summoned rays in the unnatural dungeon environment, so dispelled them after everyone was ashore.  He then immediately summoned some boars and bat swarms, which were smaller and easier to keep around.  The group headed north and east, then through an open doorway to a foul-smelling graffiti-covered room.  The crazy smelly starving woman wearing the huge belt was still there, hiding behind a table.  She was generally hostile until Vallium offered some food, then ran up to grab it.  She told them a rambling story about a small, non-demonic turtle that had crawled up the stairs with food strapped to its back, then disappeared but left her the food.  Unfortunately no more food-bearing turtles had appeared since, so she had had to return to the edge of the water to catch fish, and she had spotted the giant demon turtle still lurking in the grotto waiting to get her.  GOAT offered her a deal she didn't believe: killing her enemy the giant demon turtle and giving her all the turtle meat she wanted and a trip back to town, in exchange for her belt.  She didn't believe they could kill the turtle since it was huge and also a demon, so countered with a demand for five more rations and also a birthday cake.  (She'd missed her birthday in the cave so someone owed her some cake.)  Vallium gave her the rest of his rations, but they said they didn't have a birthday cake with them and she'd have to come back to town for that.  GOAT also claimed the turtle was dead and she should come see.  The woman didn't believe him, but ran west then south, then into the large Continually Lit room with the pillars, then opened a secret door that led into the head of the statue of Arden.  From her perch in the statue she looked down at the grotto and saw the dead giant turtle.  She then ignored the group as she repeatedly dove into the water, cut some meat off the turtle with her knife, and hid the meat in some corner of her lair.

While the woman was storing away turtle meat, the party explored west, toward a locked wooden door they had not unlocked last time.  Nobody had any lockpicks, or the key, and they didn't have Vael and his Lockmaster spell along, so after listening at the door and hearing nothing, Vallium gave it a good kick.  The door didn't open, so GOAT started sending his boars charging at it.  One boar suffered a fatal head injury, and a second boar injured itself to the point that GOAT dispelled it, but eventually the third boar managed to smash the door down.  Behind the door were some stairs, eventually leading up to another locked door, this one stone.  The door had a small slot next to it.  Ignoring the slot, GOAT cast Stone Shape on the lower half of the door and created a hole big enough to crawl through.  (Or for Basilisk to walk through.)

Peering through the hole in the door revealed a room containing a large statue of Arden holding two hammers instead of a spear, and a bunch of corpses on the floor.  Most of the bodies were human, but a couple were lizardmen, and one was some kind of large clockwork spider.  They all showed signs of extreme blunt trauma.  GOAT was very tired after shaping the worked stone, so all the spellcasters called a rest to get their energy back before entering the room.

Vallium crawled in, and a voice started yelling something in Mithric.  Ioannes translated it as "present signs of your fidelity and you shall pass."  There were slots on the inside of the wrecked door too.  Vallium checked to see if they had anything that fit the slots, and the tokens with Arden on them that they'd found in the grotto looked like they might, so he slid one in.  The voice silenced.  The door made some clicking noises, but had been too managed to open, so they all had to crawl through the hole they'd made in it.

The statue with the hammers looked menacing, but didn't move.  Vallium and the summoned animals eyed the statue, just in case, as the rest searched the bodies.  They recovered a knit cap that Ioannes thought looked magical, several shortswords, a ring, a scroll case, and a few coins.  There were also some shields that looked usable, but Ioannes thought they were too much bother to take.  They also investigated the spider construct, which looked destroyed, and had some empty storage compartments and no obvious weaponry beyond its clockwork spider legs.  There was a wooden door on the north wall.  Fortunately, this one was unlocked.  It led to a lot more stairs up, apparently enough to lead to a new level, so after a bit of climbing they decided to turn back and continue exploring behind the waterfall.

They went back down the stairs, past the scary hammer statue.  The disembodied voice went off again, warning them to present signs of their fidelity to pass.  Not sure if it was really needed, Vallium put the Arden token in the slot again, silencing the voice.  Everyone then crawled through the hole in the southern door.

They went back down the stairs, north and east past the crazy woman's room, as she continued stowing bits of turtle meat in every hiding place she could think of.  They turned north again, crawled over a barricade and a bunch of old bodies that they looted on their last visit, and reached closed doors to the north and east.  They listened at both, heard nothing, and decided to go east.  The door was unlocked and led to a large room.  It had an amazing 25' tall vaulted ceiling, beautiful teak wainscotting, and twenty large and well-crafted states of various ancient Archontean lumarnies.  Everyone recognized a few of the states, like Arden and Vul and Marius Tricotor.  One of the states had been smashed beyond recognition for whatever reason, and there was an ancient female corpse next to it.  Ioannes inspected the body and saw that whoever she was had died a violent death, with multiple horrible fractures.  The non-smashed statues looked very valuable, but also very difficult to move, as they were about 10' tall and very heavy.

Inspecting the walls, Vallium spotted a hole in the southern wall about 20' up.  GOAT directed a bat swarm to fly in and check it out, and it returned intact.  Basilisk climbed up next, and walked down the 3' tall hole.  She explored south down a rough passage, with widened to about 5'.  Eventually it reached a crossroads with other cave passages going south and east, and a worked stone passage leading west to some stairs leading up.  There was a sconce on the finished wall to the west, with a silver pendant of a Set animal hanging from it.  Basilisk absentmindedly pocketed the holy symbol, then west back to the others to report the passages and that one probably led to a temple of Set, without mentioning the holy symbol.

Someone tied a rope to a goat, who scampered up the wall on its second try.  Once the rope was up there, everyone climbed it, and then crawled south down the passage single-file.  At the intersection they continued south.  The passage eventually changed to some kind of strange white material.  GOAT thought it reminded him of insect chitin.  There were horrible burn marks on the walls and floor near the entrance, as though some kind of huge fire trap had gone off there.  There were also a couple of interesting hexagonal shapes farther down the passage, and at the end of the passage was a strange round metal door.

Suspicious of the hexagons, the group stood back while the GOAT sent a summoned goat down the passage.  When it got within about 5' of the strange hexagons, they exploded violently, sending metal fragments everywhere.  The summoned goat was absolutely obliterated.  The others were out of the blast radius, but did have to dodge some stray metal fragments.  After recovering from the shock of the explosion, GOAT sent another summoned goat down the passage.  Nothing else exploded, and it made it to the door.  The party carefullly walked up to inspect the door.  It was round, and metal, and expertly crafted.  There was no obvious handle.  They didn't hear anything when they listened at it.  There was a raised spot on the wall next to the door, but it did not contain any writing or symbols or a keyhole.  Vallium touched the panel with his armored hand, but nothing happened.  The door looked too strong to bash down, so they decided to come back when they had more ideas or a wizard with a Lockmaster spell.

The group turned back, then turned east to a new cave passage.  It led to a room with some stalagmites and stalactites, which glittered as though they might contain precious metals.  Nobody saw any obvious large chunks of precious metal to take, though, and they didn't have the equipment to start a mining operation, so they continued.  They went south, and reached another room with glittery ore.  However, this one was inhabited, by six beings that appeared to be some kind of earth elementals, who were chewing on the walls.  The elementals didn't appreciate the interruption, and charged at the intruders.

The party fought back.  Ioannes cast a Shield spell on Vallium.  Vallium and Uvash dodged and blocked and parried several blocks from large rock fists, and initially failed to injure the rock creatures.  Meanwhile Basilisk climbed up a wall and started using Kiai to stun some of the elementals, and flash nagateppos to try to blind them.  The rock creatures were skilled and tough and punched rapidly.  They smashed a couple of the GOAT's summoned animals, while he made more.  The creatures in the back that did not have room to engage in melee started picking up and throwing large rocks.  After a few seconds and only a few small wounds inflicted on the rock creatures, the party decided they were overmatched, and that it was time to retreat.  Leaving the summoned creatures behind to cover their retreat, they pulled back in good order, then GOAT used Stone Shape to mostly seal up the narrow passage behind them so the elementals could not easily follow, while Basilisk snuck through a small hole near the ceiling.  They heard the sound of pursuit behind them, but the summons and the stone plug slowed down the elementals enough that the party was able to get out of the cave tunnels before the rock creatures caught them, and the elementals did not pursue them down the rope and back into the statue room.

Deciding it was time to head back to Gosterwick, the group rounded up the crazy woman who was still busy squirreling away chunks of turtle meat, and offered her a ride on the back of a tame manta ray out of the grotto, and then to be taken back to town, where they would buy her a birthday cake.  She agreed, and the GOAT summoned some new manta rays to drag everyone against the strong current out of the grotto.  The woman said her name was Lytta, though she didn't seem too certain.  While she had apparently managed to survive in the cave for years, she was clearly not really suited to life in town, so they took her to the temple of Demma.  Father Vivian said the woman needed stronger healing magic than he knew, and recommended Mother Jador at the Temple of Mitra.  Jador took a look at Lytta and said that she had been mentally scarred by her experience living alone in the cave, trying to catch enough fish to survive while avoiding the giant snapping turtle, but could be cured by Mitra's grace.  Jador cast some kind of Cure Insanity spell, and Vallium made a large donation to the temple.  The no-longer-crazy woman thanked everyone involved profusely, and said that her real name was actually Versania.  She was from the big city of Narsileon on the coast, but had been working as a woman-at-arms for a group intending to explore the ruins of Arden Vul.  She had been fooling around near the plunge pool with some other mercenaries and had fallen in, then been sucked into the grotto by the strong current, and had somehow dodged the turtle and made it up the stairs into the dry tunnels.  She had survived there for years since, terrified of the turtle but needing to occasionally come near it and catch some fish to avoid starving.  She had no idea what to do with her life now except that she had no intention to return to Arden Vul or even get too close to Totey Lake.  In the short term she decided to volunteer at the House of the Gods to thank all of the gods for saving her.


GM's Comments:

The fight against the turtle was never that scary to the PCs once Basilisk started stunning it every turn with Kiai, but only Vallium was effectively attacking it (a manta ray was trying to help but didn't do enough damage to matter), and the turtle kept dodging.  Poor tactics by the PCs made the fight harder than it should have been, but eventually Basilisk rolled a 3 on a Kiai and I ruled it was an extra-strong Kiai that would stun for at least 2 seconds, and the -4 for stun was enough for Vallium to land an eye shot and knock it out.

I wasn't sure if the PCs would ever get around to fully searching the grotto floor, but eventually they did, and with the turtle dead they had the time they needed to find a bunch of stuff.

Boars do not have as much skull DR as goats, and so are at a bit more risk to themselves when smashing doors down with their heads.  I decided not to bother tracking exact damage to the door, since the GOAT could keep summoning more boars and there were no dangerous wandering monsters nearby so there was no real chance of failure, just a question of how efficiently the boars destroyed the door.  So I had each boar roll 3d6 vs. their Forced Entry default, and one of them rolled an 18 to critically fail and kill itself, and another rolled a 16 to hurt itself, and the third rolled well and broke down the door.  (Note: These were just animal-shaped manifestations of druidic nature force.  No actual animals were harmed in this RPG session.  Well, except the turtle, but that was a dire animal.  Also, it tried to eat the PCs first.)

I found it funny that the PCs tried Stone Shape before they tried sticking small objects in the stone door's slots, but whatever works.  In the end they didn't get hammered by the big stone statue so they must have done something right.  I was not surprised that they turned around when they realized the stairs led to another level, as these players tend to be tidy about trying to finish one area before starting another.  (At least during a session.  Between sessions, they often change goals.)

The hexagonal explosive trap was a legitimate chance for a TPK, as it did absolutely horrible damage if you were right on top of it.  But the damage dropped off quickly with distance and the PCs were smart to send in a summoned goat first, and so it was merely a One Goat Kill.

The fight against the six stone elemental creatures was also rough, but after a few turns of figuring out how tough they were, Vallium called for a retreat and the group managed to get away in good order.  Fortunately for the PCs, those big rock things were slower than them, so once they disengaged they weren't going to get caught.  And the GOATs wave of summons helped by soaking up hits and blocking the way.

Finally, they figured a way to motivate Lytta to come back to town with them (food) and a way to make her give up her magic belt (more food).  And they were generous enough to pay for a Cure Insanity for her, though that was only fair after she traded them a magic belt for a rescue and some food.  Her "seeing belt" was identified as a Belt of Dwarvenkind, which granted Night Vision but also other dwarven traits like extra fatigue points, extra lifting strength, poison resistance, and a very nice beard.  We'll see if the PCs keep the belt for its powers or sell it for the loot XP.


Achievements:

The Rescuers: 1 XP each for rescuing Lytta / Versania and curing her insanity


XP:

Exploration: 8 new locations, good for 1 XP
Loot: enough for 1 XP if they kept some magic items, or 2 XP if they sold almost everything
Achievements: 1 XP for rescue
Total: 3-4 XP depending on what they sell

Next Week:

Of course there has already been talk about going after Plumthorn's Halflings, but that happens every week and so far they have they always backed down.  They still have unexplored territory behind the waterfall, but they probably only feel safe going there if they have the GOAT and his collection of Aquaman spells.  If not, they might explore the Great Cavern or the surface ruins.

## Full Recap



Michael returned from his latest hunting trip into the mountains, but Uvash was busy trying to convert humans to dwarven monotheism, and Vael was still in Newmarket.  So the Left for Loot / Right for Riches company (I'm not sure anymore which is the real name and which is the alias) again recruited two mercenaries from the Grudge Brigade, GOAT and druid and Lacrymosa the archer.  This time they decided to revisit the Great Cavern, rather than diving behind the waterfall.



Vallium suggested filling their wheelbarrow with food in case they wanted to trade with the beastmen.  They set off early on a hot summer morning, made it to the Cliff Face without encountering anything more interesting than wild goats, and climbed up the Long Stair without problems.  They went in the secret entrance the beastmen had told them about, and followed the usual circuitous path through the eastern caverns.  This time, they ran into a couple of man-sized rock reptiles.  Vallium, Michael, and Lacrymosa made short work of them, while GOAT was trying to maneuver some summoned bears into position to help.  The only thing that went wrong was when Lacrymosa accidentally shot Vallium in the back, leaving a big ugly hole in his armor and a big impaling wound that took Ioannes's Major Healing to patch up.



Leaving the side caverns, they entered the Great Cavern proper, with its giant mushrooms.  After a brief discussion about the odd wizard in his throne, they decided to go north across the lake and explore some more of the eastern caverns.  GOAT cast Water Vision on himself and Vallium, who looked through the now clear water and saw some gold glinting on the bottom, 40 or 50 feet down.  They also saw a couple of giant crabs down there.  Lacrymosa formulated a plan: she would cast Walk on Air and look like food just above the surface, while Vallium dove underwater with the Ring of Free Action and grabbed the loot.



One of the two giant crabs took the bait and came to the surface to eat Lacrymosa, and instead ate several arrows and became crabmeat.  The other giant crab stayed underwater.  Meanwhile Vallium jumped into the lake with his armor on, ran along the bottom until he reached the gold (which ended up being a nice statuette of a dwarf), grabbed the treasure, ran back up the shore until he approached the southern dock, and then swam for the surface.



Lacrymosa ran around on air for a bit longer while the spell lasted, looking for anything interesting.  On the eastern side of the lake she found a very foul-smelling cave up above, but declined to go into it alone.  She ran back over to the small island in the middle of the lake, didn't see any treasure, then ran up to a ledge about 40 feet up on the western side of the cavern, south of the lake.  There, 3 stirges were waiting.  They surprised her and swarmed her.  A couple of them managed to wound her badly, as she retreated and filled them with arrows.  While her friends ran to the general area to try to help, she kept loosing arrows while maneuvering herself above a giant mushroom, so that if she fell she would at least land on something soft.  Vallium drew a knife, Michael drew a boomerang, and GOAT sent a couple of bat swarms up at the stirges, as Lacrymosa finished 2 stirges off.  She passed out atop a mushroom, as the swarm of bats ate the last stirge.  Ioannes cast a couple of healing spells to patch her up, as she apologized for running off alone without orders.



With the stirges dealt with, the group discussed how to cross the lake for a while, and finally piled into a skiff despite nobody having any real boating skill.  Lacrymosa, with her dexterity temporarily boosted from an Agility potion, was nominated as the most qualified boat captain.  The boat wasn't quite big enough to hold all the people, let alone all the summoned animals, so she took two trips, and managed to cross the small lake 3 times without any serious problems.



The next challenge was making it up a 50' cliff without flight magic.  The beastmen had drilled a hook into the top of the cliff to hold a rope, but nobody had a great idea for getting the rope up there, besides climbing.  Lacrymosa tried climbing, but fell off the cliff from about halfway up.  She made an acrobatics roll to reduce the severity of the fall, and Vallium and Michael caught her to cushion the blow some more.  She was still banged up, so Ioannes healed her again.  At that point Vallium decided to try the climb.  He made it about halfway up when a giant centipede emerged from the rock, tried to bite him, and failed to penetrate his armor.  He decided that falling was a bigger danger than the centipede, so ignored it and kept climbing until he made it to the top.  Once he got to safe footing, he drew his sword and chopped the vermin in half.  He then pulled the rope out of his pack, tied it to the hook, and dropped it over the edge -- to discover that he'd brought a 30' rope to a 50' cliff.  He yelled down to see if anyone had more rope.  Someone did, so he climbed down the rope, then down the cliff, grabbed the additional rope, climbed the cliff then the fixed rope, pulled the rope up, tied the other rope to it, and dropped the combined rope down so everyone else could climb up more easily.



With everyone finally at the top, they explored the northwest part of the Great Cavern above the cliff.  They found a bunch more mushrooms and a locked beastman observation cage with a door into the rock wall to the north.  Vallium made a bunch of noise outside the cage to try to attract beastman attention.  A few minutes later one sheep-headed beastman came out of the door into the cage, and asked in very broken Archontean what Vallium wanted.  Vallium told him something that he didn't quite get, so the beastman said to wait and came back with a pig-headed beastman with better language skills.  The second beastman showed interest in Vallium's offer of food, and went to fetch a sergeant and the rest of his banda.  The rat-headed sergeant asked Vallium what he wanted for the food, and Vallium asked if they had any maps of the cavern, but the sergeant said the Long Range Cavern Patrol might but he did not.  Not wanting to carry the food back, Vallium gave it to the beastmen for free in hopes of future goodwill.  The beastmen took the food, said goodbye, and locked the door.



The group walked around a bit to map the area, didn't find anything particularly interesting, then went west to a secret door they remembered from their last visit.  It took a minute to find out how to open it from this side, then they went in to the cavern where they killed some giant lizards last time.  It was empty, but the next cavern to the west contained 2 more giant lizards.  They finished off both lizards pretty quickly, with a Concussion spell then a combination of sword blows and arrows and a few bat bites.  Continuing southwest, they saw a few wounded mushroom creatures, with the large one missing a giant-lizard-mouth-sized chunk from its side.  The mushrooms wanted nothing to do with the group that had just wrecked the giant lizards, and fled south.  The group let them go, and went north up some stairs, into a room featuring a skinny dead ogre impaled on a large spike.



After searching the dead ogre and the rest of the room, they continued west, into a cave whose floor was lined with many, many bones.  They poked around in the bones a bit, but didn't find anything interesting.  However, there was a gold necklace with a red gem, just hanging on the north wall.  This was very suspicious.  But it was also obviously valuable, so they couldn't just ignore it.  Ioannes took a close look and declared that the necklace looked magical.  Vallium got ready to grab it using a blanket, but Ioannes suggested letting him use his new Apportation spell instead.  It took him about 5 tries to cast the spell (mostly because he already had 4 Bless spells up), but he successfully removed the necklace from the wall without anything obviously bad happening.  Vallium then wrapped it up in the blanket and put it in his pack.



Heading south, they smelled cooking meat.  The passage turned east, and then a trap dumped some rocks on their heads.  Vallium, in the front, was wearing a lot of armor, so it didn't hurt very much.  At the end of a passage were six skinny ogres roasting something over a fire.  They grabbed their clubs and jumped to their feet, as Lacrymosa asked the others to make room then threw a Concussion spell into the room.  This was devastating, stunning all six ogres.  She then started filling them with arrows, while Vallium and Michael chopped other ogres with their swords, and some bat swarms flew in to try to help.  Only one ogre managed to recover from the stunning, and he was outnumbered and went down a couple of seconds later.  The thing the ogres had been cooking turned out to be a halfling.  Nobody was hungry, so they went through the ogres' stuff and found some human-sized leather boots, the magical head of a statue (with empty eye sockets), and a sack with some copper coins, a few gems, and a rusty iron necklace.  They took everything except the dead halfling and the ogres' heavy clubs, and went west.  There they saw some feet sticking out under a pile of rocks.  Vallium and Ioannes again said this looked like a trap, but again decided they needed to check it out just in case there was loot.  It was a trap, with another rockfall trap above the fake rockfall trap.  Ioannes was looking up when it triggered, and dove out of the way while yelling a warning.  Vallium had his head down pulling rocks off the body, and didn't manage to dodge the falling rocks, but once again heavy scale armor saved the day and he wasn't hurt too badly.  Ioannes cast a Stop Bleeding spell and the group was ready to go.



They went back north to the room full of bones, then southwest to a sandy river beach.  They saw the underground river running west to the east south of them, and the plinth and legs and feet of a magical statue that seemed to match the head they'd found earlier.  Unfortunately, they did not have the torso.  While discussing the statue, some scrags hiding in the river snuck up to the shore to surprise them.  Unfortunately for the scrags, Vallium and GOAT still had Water Vision spells active, so they easily saw through the water and warned everyone about the scrags, so there was no surprise.  Once again, Vallium and Michael fought with swords while Lacrymosa ran around shooting arrows into the scrags, and GOAT's bat swarms got in a few nibbles.  Two of the scrags went down quickly with grievous wounds, and the third one decided it was time to dive back into the river.  Lacrymosa fired some arrows into the water, but the water was deep enough to slow their flight.  Vallium had the Ring of Free Action though, which let his sword swings work at full speed underwater, so he ran into the river and continued chopping up the surprised scrag until it was knocked out.  All three badly wounded scrags appeared to be regenerating.  Someone first suggested burning them, but nobody had any fire magic.  The next suggestion was to chop their heads off and see if they grew back, and they did not.  With the rude interruption over, the group decided to take the statue head back to Gosterwick with them rather than leaving it here, so that nobody else could take or use it.



They left the beach room to the northwest, and found a room with a few more bones and no treasure.  They went west into a room with some abandoned mining tools and a couple of corpses.  One had a magical shortsword and a magical blue gem eye that resembled the magical silver eye they'd found previously.  The other had a parchment with Archontean writing saying "red-black-yellow-blue-green-white", which Vallium thought had something to do with the colored glass teleportation squares.  It also had a map, of an unknown area with 9 rooms and some stairs up and down.



At this point they decided they'd explored enough and it was probably time to head home.  They went back out the secret door, down the cliff, across the lake, and back through the southeastern side caverns to the exit onto the Long Stair.  On the way home, they saw the wild goats again, but didn't run into anything more dangerous.





GM's Comments:



7 fights in a 4-hour session is a lot.  They went pretty quickly though.



Lacrymosa actually got into quite a bit of danger getting surprised by 3 stirges while 40' above her friends, and was knocked to 0 HP and eventually fell unconscious, but maneuvering above a giant mushroom to reduce falling damage was a nice trick.  And having a good healer like Ioannes nearby means that if you survive the fight, you can be back to full HP in a few minutes.



A flying archer versus non-flying opponents without ranged attacks is just unfair.  The giant crab never had a chance.



The combination of Water Vision and Free Action means that treasure hidden underwater actually gets found and taken.  (A Swim spell would also work, if they didn't have the Ring of Free Action.)



The Concussion spell is just too good.  The damage part is totally fine, 1d per 2 FP with damage dropping quickly away from the center like most explosive missile spells, but nobody actually uses it for the damage.  The "everything within 10 yards has to roll HT-3 or be stunned, then HT-3 every second to recover" is broken.  Too big and too exact a blast radius, too much penalty to the HT roll, and there's no reason this flavor of stun should be 3 points harder to recover from than every other flavor of stun, both in terms of game balance and having a new flavor of status to track.  ("We've had stun counters, yes, but what about second stun counters?")  I think I'm going to nerf it, and let casters learn a different spell if they think that's unfair.



I was amused that they found where the statue head went, but then took it home because they didn't want anyone else using it and finishing the puzzle before they did.  Adventurers are like little kids.





Achievements:



None





XP:

Exploration: 10 new locations, 1 XP

Loot: the magic shortsword, gems, gold dwarf statuette, and magic necklace were valuable enough for everyone to get 1 XP and some PCs to get 2 XP, depending on how they split it and how much of the treasure they sell.

Total: 2-3 XP each



Next Week:



They had the druid along this week so could have gone back behind the waterfall.  They had three good fighters this week so could have fought the halfling toll collectors.  But they chose the Great Cavern instead.  So my guess is they will keep exploring the Great Cavern, but who knows?

Michael J. Dundee, Thorcin barbarian (Adam)
Thronebreaker (Thrainor Ironvein), Dwarven mercenary fighter (Martin)

Jason, Helga, Heliagabulus, Isisor, and Yvette: Dalton's Darlings


With Vael still not back from Newmarket and Uvash still busy trying to set up a new church, the Right for Riches company hired two mercenaries, Thronebreaker and Chrysalis.  After some brief ritualistic discussion about killing Plumthorn's halflings, they decided to go down the less traveled steps into the Pyramid of Thoth and use the Scorpion teleporter, even though they were not sure where it would take them.

They bought a wheelbarrow full of food as trade goods, and walked all the way to the Cliff Face, then climbed all the way up the Long Stair to the ruins of Arden Vul, and reached the Pyramid of Thoth with no significant encounters.  They pushed both of the statue's arms straight up to open the less-used entrance, and didn't even bother spiking it open.  They proceded down the dusty stairs, past corpses they had already looted, until they reached the area where Vallium thought the slide trap was.  At that point Ioannes suggested tying a rope around Vallium, so that if he triggered the trap he would not fall very far.  However, Vallium managed to jump over the trap without triggering it, and the others followed.  They proceded down the stairs, over the closed lid over the Pit of Bones, and over to the probably-false door that they knew would open the pit.

While listening to the door Just In Case, Chrysalis heard what sounded like the skittering of rats above.  Everyone got into ambush position, and put away their light sources since the room was adequately lit by orange Continual Light.  Three undead rats and two ghouls ran into the room, and were not surprised.  They were no match for Vallium Michael, and Chrysalis, though, and the fight was over pretty quickly.

There was some discussion of having Thronebreaker destroy the false door, but someone mentioned that the pit might not open if they broke the mechanism, so instead they opened the false door (which opened the pit lid), then smashed the wall behind it.  This made a dent in the wall but did not reveal anything interesting.  At that point four of them held a rope and lowered Vallium down 25' into the pit.  He didn't find any enemies, just bones, so Michael lowered each of the others in turn.  As the last one in the room above, Michael tied the rope to the doorknob of the false door, then climbed down the rope, while Vallium prepared to catch him if necessarily.  Michael executed both the knot-tying and the rope climbing successfully, so there was no catching necessary.  However, this did cost the group a rope.

After a quick look through the bones at the bottom of the pit in case they missed any treasure, Vallium went east into the room with the scorpion statue.  As expected, one of the small spherical demons immediately came out of the black gate to attack.  Since it was expected, the ambush attack failed, and it was a five-on-one fight.  The demon got thoroughly chopped up, and then the group proceeded together to the scorpion statue.  Wary of possibly being teleported to different places, they all held hands and tried to grab the scorpion's tail together.

They teleported -- and ended up in a placed they had never before entered but had looked into from afar, the Hall of Judgment near the bottom of the Well of Light.  The half-elven druid they had spotted before was standing in front of a giant throne that looked like it had been curved from a single ruby gem.  Once again he was torturing and questioning a prisoner manacled to a post, but this time it was a muscular redheaded woman.  The druid was flanked by two giant four-armed baboons, and several smaller (but still large, about man-sized) albino baboons were watching the show.

Vallium engaged the nearer of the giant baboons.  He quickly cripped one of his arms with an accurate sword cut.  Michael heaved a boomerang, but it was dodged.  Chrysalis used Flurry of Blows to achieve super-half-elven speed, and charged the druid.  Thronebreaker attempted Intimidation, and caused the smaller baboons to hesitate to join the fight.  Ioannes moved up to cast a Shield spell on Michael.

The giant baboon engaged Vallium, but got its huge punch parried and another arm badly injured.  Michael drew his sword to helm, as Ioannes started casting Flaming Weapon.  Thronebreaker ran forward, slowly, to help the prisoner.  Chrysalis started smacking the druid around with her staff, interfering with his attempts to cast spells and direct his minions.

Quickly, the druid was knocked unconscious and one of the giant baboons was down, with a couple of crippled arms and a crippled leg.  This caused the other giant baboon and all the smaller baboons to break and run.  Vallium and Michael then gradually hacked the wounded giant baboon to bits, repeatedly crippling limbs and stunning him until he was all out of arms and legs.  Then Thronebreaker smashed the prisoner's manacles, while Michael cut the bonds around her ankles.

A door opened to the east, and a man charged in, wearing mail and holding an axe and shield, to help save his boss.  Unfortunately for him, with the druid and one giant baboon down and the others fled, he was a bit late and running into an unfair fight.  He took several hits, got knocked down, and then was killed with a blow to the skull from Chrysalis.

Freed from the torture post, Samantha the Red walked over to the ruby throne and hit a hidden stud that she had seen the druid use before.  A hidden pit opened to the southwest, and another to the southeast.  She went to pick up the evil druid and throw him in the pit, but someone asked if they should keep him alive for questioning and someone else said they should at least take off his armor first since it looked magical.  Samantha pretended not to hear the first request but acknowledged the second.  She rolled her eyes, then helped strip the druid.  Once all his gear was off, she picked him up, walked over to the pit, and threw him in.  There were two large crocodiles in the pit, and they were apparently not very trained, as they cheerfully ate their unconscious master.  An inhuman voice echoed out "The Thrice-Born Lingust!", and nobody was quite sure what that meant.  They looked in the other pit, and there was some kind of goo creature with tentacles inside, so they didn't look closer.

Samantha thanked the group for rescuing her, then pointed at the dead guy and said "that's Njal; he was the jailer."  She pointed to the door he came through and said "the cells are over there and there are three other prisoners."  Chrysalis ran in and started looking for loot in the jailer's room.  Vallium had Gerrilad's keys, and used them to unlock three cells and release Tresti the half-elven mage, Jost the Thorcin barbarian, and Gwelf the apparently insane dwarf, who was running around his cage singing silly dwarven drinking songs.  Once released, Gwelf immediately ran to the jailer's room, found the barrel of food, and ate several meals of it, then ran behind the throne and started scooping up coins from a large pile there.  Not wanting to be outdone, everyone else started scooping coins too.  There were three backpacks in the jailer's room, and three of the former prisoners each took one and filled it with coins.  When they were done picking up the coins, they saw an inscription in Mithric on the floor under where the pile had been.  Ioannes thought it said something like "Speak the Secret Name and Claim Your Reward."

The prisoners looked to their rescuers for help getting out, but the rescuers explained that they'd teleported in and didn't really know the way out, but maybe they could get up the Well of Light with Apportation if they had to.  (Neither Ioannes nor Tresti had Levitation.)  While everyone discussed what to do next, someone noticed that Gwelf was gone, and the door to the northeast was open.  Everyone eventually went that way, then west down a corridor, then south then west some more.  Eventually they found some stairs, but they went down rather than up.  There was also a closed portcullis to the west, with a lever next to it.  There were some closed doors around, but someone advised not opening closed doors, as they didn't want any more fights if they could avoid them.  Chrysalis went off exploring on her own, and ran into 6 baboons.  They mobbed her, and she retreated while occasionally smacking one with her staff, while the others rushed over to help.  By the time the rest of the group arrived, one baboon was badly hurt and the rest realized this was not the easy fight they wanted, and ran away.

The group decided to take the stairs down, and found a closed portcullis.  Beyond the portcullis was a room with 3 levers, about five yards out of reach.  Vallium asked if Ioannes could use Apportation to move the lever, but with his low magical aptitude and high number of active Bless spells, he didn't think the odds were great.  Tresti stepped up and said she could give it a try, and managed to move the lever.  The portcullis opened.  A passage lead east, past the fresh corpse of a dead adventurer, which was quickly looted of a few coins and potions.  Continuing further east, everyone saw that they were in territory they recognized, northwest of the Glory of Thoth.

Jost revealed that he knew another exit that Dalton's Darlings used to smuggle treasure out past the halflings, and that maybe they should go that way rather than giving the halflings a cut of all these coins.  Everyone agreed.  Jost led them east, then north.  He then said "watch this" and walked right through the eastern wall.  The others followed him through the illusory wall, into a room with a spiral staircase up.  At the top of the stairs, Jost indicated that everyone needed to run south and look out for stirges and giant centipedes.  Jost protected Tresti and casually knocked a strix out of the air with Njal's axe, as everyone ran south.  They then ran past several giant centipedes and up some stairs, emerging from a ruin just west of the Pyramid of Thoth.

Shortly after coming out of the ruin, they spotted another group of adventurers approaching.  When Jost saw them he was thrilled, as they were his friends, Dalton's Darlings.  Jost ran forward to embrace Dalton, who had assumed he was dead.  After the reunion, Dalton invited everyone over to the Sign of the Broken Head for a drink, while Jost relayed the story of being captured by Gerrilad and his baboons and kept in their jail in his west Thorcin hill accent.  Jost stayed with Dalton's Darlings, while the Right for Riches company took Samantha the Red and Tresti back to Gosterwick.


GM's Comments:

My Internet had gone down during a power outage the night before and was not back up by game time, so I ran this session using my phone as a hotspot for both FoundryVTT and Discord voice.  Ugh.

I was a bit surprised when the players decided on the random scorpion teleporter as their best option, and when I rolled "Hall of Judgment" I thought they might be teleporting into a TPK.  Gerrilad, 2 giant baboons, 6 large baboons, and Njal was not an easy fight, and teleporting in meant they had no line of retreat.  They had a few things in their favor, though.  One, they had brought 4 front-line fighters, an unusually tough group.  Two, Gerrilad was in the middle of a questioning session and was not really ready for a fight.  Three, Njal was in his own room and had to make a hearing roll then get his gear together before he could join.  Four, Thronebreaker has a ridiculous Intimidate skill, which came in handy for scaring away some of the baboons.  Five, and probably most critically, my GURPS conversion of the giant 4-armed baboons did not give them the Striker advantage.  My advice to big strong monsters with hands but no Strikers is to learn how to use a club.  It could save your arms! 

Almost every GURPS mage has Levitation (super useful spell, and cheap to cast if the target is light enough, with the only prerequisite being Apportation, which is itself useful), yet somehow none of the four mages in this group had it.  To be fair, only Tresti was a full-time mage; the others were all dabblers.  And she's an NPC converted from an AD&D module, so she kinda has an excuse of not really being optimized in GURPS.  Still, embarrassing.  Luckily they found another way off the level besides flying up the Well of Light, and so didn't have to fight their way through an entire Planet of the Apes sequel.


Achievements:
Prison Break: 1 XP for saving Samantha, Tresti, Jost, and maybe Gwelf.

XP:
Exploration: 15 new locations, good for 1 XP
Loot: Gerrilad's stuff, Njal's stuff, stuff they found on a dead body, a whole pile of coins: good for 1-2 XP depending on how much of the magic they sell
Achievements: 1 XP
Total: 3-4 XP 

Next Week:

Jost showed them a new entrance to the Halls, so maybe they'll try going back that way.  Or maybe they'll play Scorpion Teleporter Roulette again, as it's worked three times in a row.

## Full Recap

With Vael, Uvash, Michael, and Ioannes all busy, Vallium decided to hire the same pair of Grudge Brigade mercenaries as last time, and explore more of the ruined basement that Jost had showed them.  They brought a wheelbarrow full of food as trade goods.  It was a hot dry day, so footing was good on the Long Stair, and they did not encounter anything of note on the way to the ruins.  They continued north through the ruins of Arden Vul, past the Obilisk of the Sun, through the Forum, past the creepy square tower, to the ruined building west of the Pyramid of Thoth.

They headed down the stairs into the ruined basement, initially leaving the wheelbarrow behind.  The stairs entered a large rectangular room with the roof supported by columns, with debris and trash all over the floor, along with a couple of relatively fresh bodies.  Vallium first circled the room to find the exits, then came back to search the corpses.  Both had necrotic skin and some bite marks.  One wore scale armor and the other had mail, and one was clutching a potion that looked magic.  They stripped off the armor and took the potion, then went back up the stairs to get the wheelbarrow, and left it just behind the stairs, with the armor inside.

There were double doors in the north center of the room where Vallium remembered running past some giant centipedes, so instead they went to the northwest corner of the room, where there were doors north and west.  They listened to both doors and heard noises to the west, so went north.  A short passage led to a relatively clear room, containing an anvil with a silver chalice on it.  This looked suspicious, but after some discussion Stonebreaker knocked the chalice off the anvil with his axe, and nothing interesting happened, so Vallium took the chalice and put it in the wheelbarrow.

Continuing north, they listened at another door, heard nothing, and opened it.  Inside was a dusty room with Thothian frescoes on all the walls and a large stone altar.  There were what looked like barefoot human footprints in the dust.  Vallium searched the altar and though he found a hidden compartment.  He tried opening it and a needle flashed out, but he moved his hands away in time.  All three adventurers looked for a way to open the compartment without smashing it (because they were afraid of damaging whatever was inside), but didn't find one.  They left the alter for another time.

Farther north, they found another room containing a dead halfling, with leather armor, a shortsword, a sling, a pouch with some spikes and a flask of oil, and a note about using a little pyramid to access the Howling Caves.  They found another room with its door spiked just slightly ajar.  Inside were a ridiculously heavy magic spear with some Mithric writing on it that Chrysalis couldn't quite puzzle out, along with a pouch with some coins and small green gems. They took everything and again carried it all back to the entrance room to stow it in their wheelbarrow.

While crossing the entrance room, Vallium spotted several giant centipedes, which had squeezed between the not-quite-closed the doors to the north.  A brief fight ensued, where all the centipedes were quickly killed.

They next decided to try the western door that they had bypassed before.  As they did, some large spiders tried to jump on Vallium's head, but he saw them and jumped back.  The spiders swarmed out and surrounded the three adventurers.  This led to a fairly long fight, where Chysalis parried a lot of spider bites with her two staves, while the three adventurers gradually killed the spiders.  The spiders were good at dodging, but bad at surviving once they got hit.  Once the spiders were eliminated, Vallium (wearing the Ring of Free Action) waded into their room through their webs looking for treasure, while Chrysalis and Thronebreaker rested and guarded outside.  Vallium quickly found a book written in a weird language that nobody even recognized, and later found a small red gem.  Chrysalis wondered if there might be more treasure in the webs, so asked Thronebreaker to cast Seek Earth for both silver and gold.  Both pointed back to the wheelbarrow, so they were satisfied that there was nothing else in the webs.

Continuing to explore, the group went north then east then south, again avoiding the double doors where they suspected there might be more centipedes.  They first found an old storeroom full of only junk and debris.  They then found another storeroom, this one containing a single zombie wearing a dog collar.  They were prepared for a fight, but then surprised when the zombie merely walked up to Vallium and didn't attack him.  Attempts at conversation were fruitless, but the zombie doggedly followed Vallium around.  Eventually they took the zombie's collar, and it didn't resist.  Chrysalis suggested putting a backpack on the zombie, but Vallium declined.  Eventually they decided to leave the zombie in the room and close the door so it wouldn't follow them.

They continued south, to the other side of the double doors, but didn't see any centipedes.  Vallium fully opened a stuck door so they could get out that way without having to squeeze through.  They then continued east, and saw some light coming under the door, along with the foul stench of rotting vegetation.  The door had a lock on it, which looked recently oiled.  Vallium knocked on the door, but nobody answered.  He opened the door, which was unlocked.  Inside was a room that wasn't fully of trash, and had actually been swept.  On the far wall was a pot containing some horrible-smelling stew, over a magical heating tripod.  There were also a few vermin corpses arranged on the walls to dry.  They looked around a bit, but whoever lived there wasn't home, so they left.

They continued east then north, found doors north and west, and didn't hear anything behind either.  They opened the western door and saw a room containing a stone pedestal with a statue of a money on it, with its oversized mouth wide open.  A few seconds after they entered the room, the monkey coughed loudly at Thronebreaker, who was not affected.  At that point they saw a second monkey statue flying to the west, with huge eyes.  The second monkey looked at Vallium, and fire shot out of its eyes and tried to burn him, but failed to penetrate his armor.  Vallium wrestled the first monkey to turn its mouth away from Thronebreaker and stop the attacks, then started smashing it against the pedestal.  Meanwhile Chrysalis went over to the flying monkey and knocked it out of the air with her staff.  A third, previously unseen, flying monkey, this one with huge ears, flew near Thronebreaker and let loose a loud shriek.  He hit it with a Power Blow and shattered it.  Vallium smashed the non-flying statue against the pedestal again, then Chrysalis and Thronebreaker joined in with their weapons, and all the monkey statues were no longer a threat.  Vallium picked up a bone scroll case from the floor.  There was also a corpse on the floor, with its ears bleeding.  Vallium took a gold ring, some leather armor, and a small ingot off the body, and they returned to the wheelbarrow to stow their loot.

Continuing west from the monkey room, they listened to another door and heard nothing.  The door was stuck closed, but Vallium muscled it open.  He went into another room to search the debris, but once he disturbed something, the ceiling started caving in.  He charged back out the door before any debris landed on his head.  The cave-in continued for a while, leaving that room impassable.

Going back east to a door they had bypassed, they found a room with a pool of smelly sludge and a female corpse, this one with no armor.  She looked drained, as if by a strix.  They ignored the sludge, but looted the body, getting a dagger, a bag of gold dust, and a scroll that Chrysalis said was Detect Magic.  Going west from the sludge pool room, they found a door, behind which they heard crunching sounds.  Everyone got ready, then they opened the door and charged in.  They failed to surprise a large many-tentacled creature that was noisily eating a human body.  It attacked Vallium a few times with tentacles and bites, but he parried and blocked and dodged, and then it was three on one.  They knocked the creature unconscious within a few seconds, then Vallium stabbed it a lot to ensure it never woke up.  The half-eaten corpse had some mail, a broadsword,  and a pouch with a few coins and a map.  The map showed several rooms, and had notes in Archontean like "secret?" and "short jerks."  



Once again they carried all the loot back to their wheelbarrow.  On the way, they ran into a barefoot old man who looked like he hadn't shaved or bathed in a years.  He introduced himself as Lankios, and invited them back to his room to talk.  He offered some of his (foul-smelling) stew, which they initially declined.  A long and rambling conversation ensued, where Lankios claimed to have been one of the former leaders of Adrienic's expedition, and said something about a crime where someone named K killed someone named Guivrel.  The story didn't make a lot of sense.  He also warned them about the nearby vermin.  Vallium asked if he wanted to go back to town, but Lankios declined, saying he needed to remain here until the crime was solved, but he wasn't as good at going up and down ladders as he used to be.  Vallium donated their extra food to Lankios, and ate a bit of his foul stew.

Vallium thought they had explored most of the level except for the stirge-infested area to the north, and suggested they try to run past the stirges into the other rooms there then slam the door, rather than fighting a possibly huge number of stirges.  They successfully managed to run past the stirges into a room to the northeast, with a few parries and blocks required.  Once they closed the door behind Thronebreaker, they looked around and saw that the eastern wall had collapsed, but there were some legs sticking out, and there was one boot on one of the feet.  Chrysalis and Thronebreaker thought the boot looked magic, so Vallium and Thronebreaker tried moving stones while Chrysalis pulled the body out.  The single boot was all they managed to get though.

Thronebreaker thought there was another door nearby to the southwest and it was open, but Vallium remembered it as closed.  In any case, they decided to repeat their trick of running to the other door past the stirges then shutting it to keep them out.  Thronebreaker was correct and the door was open, so this was pretty easy; they only had to parry a couple of stirge attacks to get inside.  The room contained four stone vats, one empty, one with water, one with some foul-smelling rancid former food of some sort, and one with lamp oil.  They didn't need any water or oil, so they left.  This time, they sprinted north, toward the stairs that they came up last time.  The stairs spiraled down a few hundred feet, into a square room with no obvious exits.  They walked through the illusory wall to the west, into a room with an open wooden door south, a closed stone door south, and a closed wooden door west.

They listened to the closed doors, heard nothing, and went west.  The room there contained two animated skeletons of baboons, who attacked.  Vallium shield rushed it and it went down hard, as if particularly brittle to crushing damage.  Chrysalis smashed the other one with her staff and it fell to pieces.  The only semi-intact furniture in the room was a single cupboard, which contained a few pieces of parchment with Mithric writing that Chrysalis could not puzzle out.

The stone door to the south did not have a handle and they could not figure out a way to open it.  Thronebreaker pulled out his portable battering ram, enlisted Vallium to help, and powered up Power Blow.  Together they smashed it for enough damage to shatter the door.  They proceeded south down a passage, through a normal wooden door, into a mostly empty room containing an old wooden desk and chair covered in gold leaf.  Gold is gold, as the dwarves say, so the three of them spent the next fifteen minutes painstakingly removing gold leaf and putting it in a pouch.  Thronebreaker then noticed a few flakes the others had missed and spent a couple more minutes making sure absolutely no gold was left behind.

They went through a door east into a room with a couple of inches of dust on the floor, and some bright orange light coming through peepholes near some large bronze double doors to the south.  As they searched the room, some of the dust formed into a miniature tornado, which attacked them.  The wind blew them around enough that Chrysalis and Thronebreaker had a hard time keeping their bearings, but Vallium's magic ring left him unaffected.  The three of them took turns bashing the dust creature, but their blows only did minimal damage, so it took a long time to beat it down.  It failed to injure any of them, however.  When it finally went down, they dumped some water on its remains, which seemed to finish it off.  Searching the room revealed a magic halberd and a human corpse.  The body had a gold signet ring with "Gregor" inscribed, a magic potion, and a flask of water.

At that point, Vallium declared that they had found enough treasure and he did not want to press their luck further by opening any more doors.  So they went back up the stairs, then tried sprinting past the stirges again.  This time, about a half-dozen were waiting for them, and one managed to bite Thronebreaker.  It was only a minor wound, and then they were past the stirge lair.  They continued back to their wheelbarrow, dragged it up the stairs, and headed back south across the ruins, down the Long Stair, and then back to Gosterwick.

Once back in town, Thronebreaker discovered he was feeling awful: the minor stirge bite was starting to give him a nasty case of Stirge Fever.  Not wanting to unnecessarily spend any of his hard-earned gold on a cleric, he sat at home, counting his money, and waiting for his strong dwarven immune system to fix the problem.


GM's Comments:

Three-player sessions move faster than four- or five-player sessions, and in this case one of the PCs was clearly in charge and the other two were working for him, so it was fun to watch people make quick decisions and methodically explore a level.


Achievements:
None

XP:
Exploration: 18 new locations, good for 1 XP
Loot: magic spear, magic halberd, lots of valuable weapons and armor, etc., good for 2 XP
Total:  3 XP

Next Week:

We should have more PCs next time.  Maybe they'll try to finish off the stirges, or the halflings, or something else.

Michael J. Dundee, Thorcin barbarian (Adam)
Uvash Edzuson, Dwarven cleric of Zodarrim (Cosmo)
Vael Sunshadow, Half-Elven mage (Kyle)

Undead librarian


Vael returned from Newmarket, after doing some shopping and failing to meet the wizard in the Tower of the Ape.  He rounded up Michael, Uvash, and Ioannes for a trip back to the ruins of Arden Vul.  After ascending the Long Stair (with 3 of them roped together and Vael Levitating) they decided to go down the Well of Light.  Vael first cast Darkness above the Well to make the mirrored shaft less blindingly bright inside, then cast Flight on Michael, who carried each of the others down the Well in turn.

The mirror at the bottom of the well was once again covered in debris and baboon feces.  The group spent a few minutes cleaning it off, then went east then southwest and explored a small room with some benches and and inscription on the wall that said "Let the Faithful Render Honor and Glory to the Light Which Reveals All” in Mithric.  Ioannes poked at a magical-looking marble circle on the floor with his axe, then stood on it, but nothing interesting happened.

The group continued southwest, then went east down a narrow passage that ended in two doors.  They listened at both doors, and heard low mumbling behind one and hooting behind the other.  Vael and Ioannes cast Blur and Shield on Michael, and they opened the northern door.  Behind it was a large room containing 4 of the large albino baboons, who immediately charged at the intruders.  Michael and Uvash fought them in the doorway, while Vael cast Grease and Smoke in front of the other door.

While Michael crippled both arms of a baboon, the other door opened and a giant 4-armed baboon came running out, then slipped and fell on the grease.  Michael backed up to fight the big one while it was down, while Uvash and Ioannes continued fighting the smaller baboons.  Michael landed several solid blows on the huge one while it struggled to get up, while Uvash killed one of the smaller baboons.  Two of the baboons ran away, but not before one of them landed a crippling blow on Ioannes' right arm.  The big one, almost dead, tried to surrender, but then passed out.  After waiting a few minutes for him to get up, the group decided to just kill him, along with another unconscious baboon.  Uvash cast Major Healing on Ioannes, and his arm fortunately started working again.

Worried the fleeing baboons might bring friends, they explored the northern room, which appeared to be a dining room with only one table.  They spotted a goblin peeking though a doorway to the east.  Continuing to the east, they found a kitchen, with 3 scared goblins who appeared to be cooks.  Chained to the walls were two humans and a one-armed dog-headed beastman.  One of the goblins spoke a bit of Archontean, and said that his name was Brokenneck and he and his companions had been captured and enslaved by the baboons.  One of the humans chained to the wall was Ketil, a ranger with a strong Wiskin accent.  The other was Egrk, who didn't speak any Archontean.   The beastman was Marco, whose missing arm had been used as an ingredient in one of Yrsko the giant 4-armed baboon chef's meals.  Ioannes cast Gift of Tongues to enable communication with Egrk, and ascertained that he lived in a cave west of the waterfall and had been taken by a nocturnal raiding party of baboons.  The others had similar stories.  Also in the kitchen were a fireplace with a chimney heading up, and a large magical cauldron.  Ioannes asked the goblins about the cauldron, and they explained that if you said one word it got hot and if you said a different word it got cold.

Michael tried breaking Ketil's chains, but they were too strong to snap without heavy tools.  Vael asked Brokenneck if he had the keys, and the goblin replied that Yrsko the big baboon cook had them.  

The group went into the room to the south, which appeared to be the big baboon's bedroom, and contained a makeshift bed, a chest, and a bookshelf.  Vael cautiously Apportated the chest open, and inside were a few chef's hats, a dirty apron, a nice quality knife, and some keys.  There were also a couple of cookbooks on a bookshelf, one focused on mushroom dishes, the other on general Archontean cuisine.  Vael grabbed the knife, books, and keys.  Returning to the kitchen, they unlocked all the prisoners.  They told them they would get them all out, and asked the goblins to carry the cauldron.

Continuing south from Yrsko's room, they saw closed doors to the south and east.  They listened to both and didn't hear anything.  They first went south, and found a room with paintings of a jungle scene with baboons on the wall.  To the south was a mulch pit full of mushrooms.  As they approached, one of the mushrooms started shrieking.  Ioannes stepped forward to silence it.  This was effective, but offended a couple of small mushroom people who were hiding in the mulch pit.  Both attacked Ioannes, the first ineffectively, the second landing a pretty good punch.  This drew the attention of Michael and Uvash, who finished off both of the mushroom men.

On the east side of the room was a large bust of a middle-aged Archontean man, which appeared magical.  Vael tried talking to the statue, and he surprisingly responded.  He said his name was Stamelis and he had been a Librarian of Thoth.  Vael and Ioannes asked Stamelis a lot of questions, and he verified that the Library of Thoth was just to the west of here, that this had been Gerrilad's room, that Gerrilad hasn't been here for a couple of weeks, and that Gerrilad was not an adherent of Thoth, but followed some odd nature religion and seemed to have an unhealthy obsession with baboons.  Vael wanted to take the statue with them, but it was hundreds of pounds, so they left it for now, but told Stamelis that they would return.

They checked the door to the north, and found a bedroom, with nobody home.  There was a chest, which Vael again used Apportation to open.  Inside was a small silver mirror and some platinum coins, which Vael took.

Heading west, the large group went through a door, saw some double doors to the south, but continued west through a single door into a cobwebby corridor.  Vael was suspicious of spiders, but didn't see any.  Michael eventually bravely walked right through the webs toward a door on the north wall, but as he approached it a previously unseen glyph on the floor glowed purple, and Michael ran away to the east.  Vael gave Michael a few minutes to get it together, then Levitated over to the glyph.  It went off even though he didn't touch it, but Vael was able to override the magical fear and open the door.

The room beyond the door contained an old rotted bed with a rotted corpse in it, and a pedestal holding a large ball of arcanum.  There were also some shelves, but Vael was drawn to the arcanum and started investigating it.  He decided to cast Analyze Magic, but when he touched the globe of arcanum, the body rose from the best and ran over to stop him.  Vael dropped his backpack and retreated while yelling for help.  Michael responded, and this time managed to pass the fear glyph.  Michael, Uvash, and Ioannes chopped up the undead creature.  Once it was down, Ioannes went back in the hallway and gathered up their rescued prisoners and cast Bravery on all of them, then herded them all past the glyph into the room.

Vael resumed casting the Analyze Magic spell that had been interrupted, but after about ten minutes the thoroughly dismembered corpse of an undead librarian started twitching again.  Vael again suspended his spell and cast Create Fire on the corpse, incinerating it.  That problem eliminated, he went back to analyzing the globe.  After about an hour, he noted that the arcanum could be used to recharge magic items, and had other powers.

Not wanting to spend all day analyzing the arcanum in this dangerous environment, the group decided to escape from the Halls and analyze the globe back at the Arcane Practitioners' Club.  First Vael mentioned using the small pyramid to teleport back to the other small pyramid and then take the goblins down to Gog, but Ioannes reminded him that they had never teleported in that direction and didn't know if it was possible.  They then decided to just fly everyone back up the Well of Light to the surface.  Vael asked Ketil to carry the arcanum globe, and the goblins to take the cauldron again, and they all went north back to the bottom of the Well.  Vael cast Flight on Michael again, and he flew up and down the well many times, carrying either somebody or some heavy piece of loot on each trip.  After ten trips up and down, everyone was at the top.  The three goblins had run off in the commotion, but they left the magic cauldron.

The group and their remaining followers headed south through the ruins then west to the dam, where they had a wheelbarrow stashed.  They put the arcanum and cauldron in the wheelbarrow, then continued south to the Long Stair.  About a third of the way down, Marco the Beastmen said goodbye and went into the secret door into the Great Cavern.  At the bottom of the cliff, Egrk waved goodbye and headed west.  Ketil the Wiskin ranger went back to Gosterwick with the party, and helped push the wheelbarrow.

I was surprised the PCs chose the Well of Light, as the line of retreat relies heavily on magical flight, but they managed to get in, kill some baboons and an undead librarian, find a big honking globe of arcanum, and get out.


Achievements:

The Rescuers: 1 XP for rescuing 3 goblins, Egrk, Ketil, and Marco

XP:
Exploration: 7 new locations,  1 XP
Loot: Magic cauldron, a few coins and gems, and a big ball of arcanum.  2 XP if they sold the arcanum.  They kept it, so 1 XP.
Achievements: 1 XP
Total: 3 XP

Next Week:
Ioannes expressed interest in finding the Library of Thoth and moving Stamelis there.  So there's a chance they will attempt that.  There was also continued griping about Plumthorn's Halflings being in the way of wherever they want to go, so maybe they'll try removing them.

# DFRPG Arden Vul Session 19: The Pool of Donkey Ears

Date: 

Demmasday, 18th of Masporios, 2993 AE 


Weather: 

Hot, dry


Player Characters: 

Michael J. Dundee, Thorcin barbarian (Adam)
Uvash Edzuson, Dwarven cleric of Zodarrim (Cosmo)
Vael Sunshadow, Half-Elven mage (Kyle)
Vallium Halcyon, Archontean fighter (Greybrown)
Ethereum "Coinbase" Thuringwador, Elf Illusionist (Mercenary) (Archon Shiva)



Significant NPCs:

Several of Kronos's Thorcin guards
Kronos, innkeeper at the Sign of the Broken Head
Lankios, ancient Archontean hermit
Zombie porter
Many stirges
Gray ooze
4 Baboon skeletons
Human skeleton
Several halfling toll collecting gangsters
Ibis-headed guardian of Thoth
Animated statues of Sekhmet and Osiris
Lion construct


Ioannes was not available, so the group visited the Grudge Brigade to hire a mercenary.  The mercenary on call was the annoying elf Coinbase, who immediately started trying to sell everyone on his new illusion-based tactical assistance system and also on the GOAT's new living (and thus able to be Levitated) wheelbarrow, available for sale soon.  As part of his continuing attempt to make friends and influence people, Vallium bought another (regular) wheelbarrow load of food.

When they reached the Long Stair up to the ruins of Arden Vul, Vael and Coinbase decided to Levitate themselves up, while the others roped themselves together and started hiking.  The ropes were a good idea, as Uvash slipped and went right over the edge, but Vallium and Michael yanked him back up.

They pushed the wheelbarrow all the way to the north end of the ruins, where Kronos's guards occupying the northern gate towers hailed them and engaged them in a brief conversation.  Nobody had any significant news to share, so they headed west to the Broken Head.  Kronos himself was outside supervising his staff, and Vallium sold him half of his wheelbarrow of provisions at cost.  Kronos was happy to make the deal and asked if anyone wanted to come into the inn for a drink, but Vael said that they didn't want to drink and delve but might come back later.

The group doubled back east and south near the Pyramid of Thoth, and Vallium showed them the stairs leading down into a nearby ruin.  They left their wheelbarrow by the stairs, and Vallium took everyone north to the room with the altar that had a secret compartment that he had not figured out how to open.  Vallium showed them where the panel was, and how to trigger a poison needle trap.  He expected Vael to magic it open, but instead Vael just figured out the trick and hit the panel in the right spot.  Inside was a bag containing a bunch of small red gems and a small magical silver feather token.

Vallium then took the group east to Lankios's room, but the hermit was not home.  Vallium left a bunch of food by the old man's pungent stew pot, and Vael wrote Lankios a note.  Next Vallium took them west to the room with the zombie porter, warned everyone that there was a friendly zombie inside and not to kill it, and then opened the door.  The zombie once again slowly walked right up to Vallium, and Vallium demonstrated putting a backpack on the porter and then having the porter slowly follow him around wearing it.  They didn't really need the porter, though, so Vallium took his backpack back and closed the porter in the room again.

Next they decided how to deal with the room full of stirges.  Michael had a serpent amulet to protect him from fire, and Vallium had a fire resistance potion, so the plan was to create a bunch of fire and have them fight the stirges from within it, while Vael strategically moved the flames around to torch stirges.  This plan worked pretty well; Vallium and Michael killed a few stirges, Vael's magical fire burned a couple more, and the rest fled up a chimney.  Vael then used Shape Earth to fuse the chimney shut so the stirges couldn't return to the room.  The group then tore the stirge nest apart, finding some coins, some magic incense, a small magic bronze baton, and some adventurer's diary.  Once all the loot was removed, Vael burned the stirge nest.

There were several stone vats in the room to the south, which had been left intact last time.  Vael was suspicious that something might be hidden in one of them, so he had Michael tip the three full vats over, so they could thoroughly search them.  No treasure was found, but the vat full of something spoiled made the whole room stink, to the point where Vael needed to cast Purify Air.

There were two unexplored doors to the west.  One just led to a hallway, and the group walked around a bit completing their map.  Another led to a privy, with the smelly privy shaft going deeper than the range of their Continual Light, and unexpectedly containing ladder rungs.  Nobody felt like climbing down a ladder, but Vael cast Wizard Eye and put a dim Continual Light on it, then sent the Eye down to scout.  The shaft went down about 500 feet.  At the bottom was a natural cavern, with exits east and west, and a paved area to the south containing a sarcophagus and four burned corpses.  One of the corpses had what appeared to be magical mail armor, along with a longsword and a metal shield.

That was enough treasure that they couldn't just leave it, so they discussed whether it would be better to cast Levitation on both Vael and Coinbase, or Flight on Michael or Vallium.  (Vael could not easily maintain Flight on multiple people at once.)  Michael volunteered, so he dropped his backpack and shield to reduce his load, and Vael cast Flight on him.  Michael zoomed down the shaft, and noticed a ring tied to a ladder rung near the top.  Not wanting to waste spell duration, he yelled to the others about the ring and resumed flying down, while Coinbase Levitated down a few feet to grab the ring.  When Michael got to the bottom he looked around a bit, then headed to the corpses to take their stuff.  He quickly grabbed the sword and shield and was partway through removing the mail armor when he saw a gray ooze creeping along the ceiling to attempt to drop on his head.  Michael was much faster than the ooze, so rather than risking a solo fight, he flew around it to the far end of the cavern, waited for it to come get him, then flew back around it to the corpses and finished taking the mail, then flew back around it again and up the privy shaft.

While Vael rested to recover from maintaining Flight, a couple of the others went to fetch the wheelbarrow, put most of the loot in it, and stash it behind a door where other adventurers were unlikely to find it.  Vael cast Seek Earth for gold, and sensed some gold about 15 yards south.  Everyone searched for secret doors on the southern wall, and eventually found one.  It was locked.  Vael found the keyhole but nobody had a key that fit, so he Lockmastered it open.  Vallium opened the door, into a room with a human skeleton with an axe and 4 baboon skeletons.  The skeletons attacked, a brief fight ensued, and the adventurers won, with a shield rush from Coinbase into the human skeleton's back knocking it down and making it stop dodging so effectively, so Vallium and Michael could chop it up.

The room didn't contain the expected gold, so everyone searched for secret doors again.  This time, the secret door was unlocked, and behind it was a small room with a bunch of golden altarware, a small coffer full of silver coins, and a small ivory and ebony statue of Thoth.  They took all the treasure and added it to the pile in their wheelbarrow.  Vael tried another Seek Earth looking for gold, and another one looking for platinum, and a Seek Magic, but all the nearest treasures appeared to be up on the surface or another level, so they decided this one was done.  Vael was unhappy with his empty map, though, so he had the others guard him while he circled the level mapping.  When they reached the pool of sludge, he filled a vial with a sample to check out in the alchemy lab back at the Arcane Practitioners' Club in Gosterwick.

Finally done mapping the basement, the group went north to the spiral stairs down, then down the stairs to the halfling level, then through the illusory wall.  Vallium led the group south through the remnants of the one-way door that he and Thronebreaker had destroyed, then east through the room where they had killed a dust elemental, to a previously unexplored door.  Everyone listened at it, then they opened it and found a room bisected by the Great Chasm, with a narrow bridge crossing it.  Vael and Coinbase Levitated over, while the others carefully crossed the bridge.  To the south was a halfling guard post overlooking the chasm, and they heard the sounds of halflings yelling about their lights and calling more guards.  In the center of the room was a large statue of Thoth in baboon form, with both arms on pins.  There was a door on the north wall and two doors on the east wall, and listening revealed no sound behind any of them.  Someone tried one of the doors, but it was locked, and Vael thought something on the door looked magic.  At that point Vael started manipulating the statue arms into various combinations of positions.  A couple of positions seemed to cause noises far away, or maybe that was just the halflings.  Another position caused a secret door on the east wall to open, and an angry ibis-headed construct of Thoth came out to attack.  The fight was five on one, though, so the construct didn't last very long.  After it was dispatched the group searched the small secret room it had come out of, but found nothing.

Vael went back to playing with the statue arms, and eventually managed to open one of the eastern doors.  They went east down a hallway, then north into a room with three sarcophagi.  Uvash tried a spell to detect undead, and didn't find any.  Vallium took the lid off a sarcophagus, and a bunch of darts flew out at him.  One was directly on target, but his amulet of missile protection caused the dart to curve around him.  Inside the sarcophagus was a mummy.  They tore the wrappings open to find some jade jewelry and a garnet gem.  Vallium repeated the process with the other two sarcophagi, with similar results.  Vael carefully scooped up all the darts into a pouch, hoping whatever black substance they were covered with was worth something.

They continued down the passage to the east and found a huge room to the north, containing 6 large statues and one huge statue.  Uvash identified all seven statues for the group: Sekhmet, Set, and Anubis down the right side; Osiris, Horus, and Isis on the left, and a much bigger statue of Thoth in the north center.  A few minutes after everyone came in, the statues of Sekhmet and Osiris moved into the center of the room and started smashing each other.  The Thoth statue yelled "Halt" in Mithric (which only Uvash spoke, and not well) and both statues froze, with Osiris dropping his (human-sized, magical-looking) flail.  Thoth then yelled something like "a smart one must choose" in Mithric.  Vael could not resist, and picked up the flail.  At that point the lion on top of Sekhmet's head animated into a separate construct and attacked Vael, while the rest of the group found themselves completely frozen in place and unable to act.  The lion construct tried to bite Vael, and in response he Blinked 3 yards straight up, out of its reach.  After making sure there was no way the statue could reach him, he then calmly started dropping acid, Alchemist's Fire, and small Concussion spells onto the statue until it was destroyed.  As the unfair fight finished, the Thoth statue yelled "Halt" again, and everyone unfroze.  Vael felt some kind of divine blessing make him slightly tougher, and kept the flail.

The group continued east, and saw some orange Continual Light coming from a room to the south, containing a fountain.  Breaking their usual directional rules, they headed for the light.  The fountain appeared magical.  Uvash took a sip, and his ears transformed into donkey ears.  This did not appear to affect his hearing either way; he just looked weird.  (Though he had a chain coif, so he really only looked weird if he took it off.)  The rest of the group decided not to take a drink.

Everyone went west from the fountain, then south into a room with 3 more sarcophagi and a bunch of small holes in the floor.  Everyone except Vallium and Uvash stepped out of the room.  Uvash tried to detect undead, and didn't find any.  Vallium opened a sarcophagus lid.  A bunch of spears came out of the floor, stabbing the armored legs and feet of both of them.  Fortunately, none of the spears managed to penetrate their armor.  Uvash left the room, and Vallium climbed up on top of the sarcophagus, out of spear reach, to continue his looting.  The first sarcophagus contained another mummy, along with some rusty mail and a shield.  Vallium unwrapped the mummy to find more jade jewelry.  He repeated the process with the other two sarcophagi, avoiding the spear holes, and got some more jewelry as well as a couple of maces, a scroll, and a small pouch of silver coins.

Judging that they had enough treasure for the day, the group carefully traced their steps back over the chasm bridge, through the illusory wall, up the spiral stairs, and retrieved their wheelbarrow.  They then headed up to the surface ruins of Arden Vul, south to the Long Stair, down the cliff face, and back to Gosterwick.  Their luck held on the hot summer day, and nothing attacked them on the way home.

GM's Notes:

Arden Vul's got 1100 pages of intricate level design with complicated factions and deep history, but it's also got magic pools that can give you donkey ears, like some TSR adventure from 1978 written under the influence of Thoth-knows-what.  Fantastic.

I thought Vael was the PC least suited to the solo combat scenario against Thoth's pet lion statue, but he demonstrated that if you can fly, your opponent can't reach you or run away, and you have any ranged attacks with lots of ammo, you will eventually win.  No style points, but he won.  Also, "up" is a valid direction for Blink if the ceiling is high enough, and this is particularly useful if you have Levitation on.


Achievements:

None


XP:
Exploration: 9 new locations,  1 XP
Loot: Some coins and gems and jewels and gold and silver.  A few minor magic items.  The most valuable thing by far was the fine mail armor that Michael dragged up from beneath the privy.  2 XP
Achievements: None
Total: 3 XP each.  Vael also got 1 extra HP for the statue fight.


Next Week:
Maybe they'll keep exploring this level and see if anyone else can get donkey ears.  Maybe they'll go back up to the baboon level and look for the Library of Thoth.  Maybe they'll go back down the privy.  I have no real idea at this point, and I suspect the players don't either.

# DFRPG Arden Vul Session 2: Halfling Rent-Seekers

Date:

Demmasday, 21st of Toternios, 2993 AEP


Weather:

Cool, cloudy


Player Characters:

Ioannes Grammatikos Byzantios, Archontean cleric of Demma (Demented Avenger)
Vael Sunshadow, Half-Elven mage (Kyle)
Uvash Edzuson, Dwarven cleric of Zodarrim (Based Cosmo)
Vallium Halcyon, Archontean fighter (Greybrown)
Thorne Lasselanta Ashcroft, Half-Elven monk (mercenary) (Archon Shiva)


Significant NPCs:

Margot the Red, innkeeper at the Yellow Cloak Inn
Bricwine, bartender at the Yellow Cloak Inn
Tasha, tailor
Creon, pawnbroker
Unidentified huge flying reptilian beast
Roskelly Winterleaf, halfling underground toll collector lieutenant
Several halfling toll collectors
12 giant rats


When the PCs returned to Gosterwick after their previous delve, Ioannes was confronted by Margot the Red, Innkeeper at the Yellow Cloak Inn, for leaving some sheets with Continual Darkness (accidentally) cast on them in his room and freaking out the maid. Margot informed Ioannes that her husband Bricwine had needed to throw those sheets into Totey Lake before the maid was willing to go back into that room, and that as a result Ioannes owed the Inn 5 silver pieces for some new bedding. And that furthermore spellcasting, even by good clerics of Demma, was not allowed on the premises because Sometimes Someone Makes a Mistake and Look a Demon, and please take that outside the town walls. Ioannes meekly agreed to pay the fee, and retained his right to use the Inn. However, both Ioannes and Vael decided that getting an apartment at the Arcane Practitioners Club made more sense than staying in an inn with such stuffy rules, even it it meant no maid service and needing to walk somewhere to get meals.

Most of the PCs spent a week in Gosterwick, training and identifying and selling loot from their previous adventure and shopping. Michael, however, got bored in town and went on a hunting trip, and was not back in time for this delve. The party managed to recruit another tough-looking fighter, Vallium, to help protect the mages and clerics. They also walked over to the Grudge Brigade Mercenary Company's "Headquarters" (a small building on the outskirts of Gosterwick). Ashe the druid was also not around this time, but a half-elven monk carrying a pike and a couple of long staves named Thorne Lasselanta Ashcroft was willing to accompany the group for a share of treasure.

This time they left a couple hours before dawn, to give themselves more time in the ruins before sunset. Vael had dragged along a wheelbarrow this time, saying it would be easier to push his pack than carry it. Once again the group made the treacherous climb up the Long Stair without anyone slipping and falling to their death. The only encounter on the way up was with some mountain goats, who just watched them curiously and did not cause trouble. When they reached the top of the climb and entered the ruins of Arden Vul between the ruined gate towers, the group had a debate about which way to explore. Suggestions included descending into the darkness of the squat tower, climbing the Pyramid of Thoth, and going west to see what was near the top of the waterfall. The waterfall seemed closest, so the group went west.

One of the ruined buildings on the way looked a bit better preserved than the rest, so the party decided to search it. About an hour of digging around in the rubble without tools generated nothing of interest, and a couple of comments that someone should bring some picks and shovels next time, or, better yet, learn some labor-saving earth magic. Continuing west, they reached the Swift River above the cliff, with a large pond or small lake to their north, a swampy area west of the river, a couple of rotting old bridges spanning the river, a dam separating the lake from the river, and the waterfall going over the cliff to the south, between two towers. They took a look at both bridges and confirmed they looked flimsy and that levitating over the river would be a much safer way to cross. Heading north to the dam, they saw a locked door on the side of it.

Nobody brought lockpicks or lock-opening magic, but the mercenary brought a huge fine quality pike, and decided to start smashing the lock with it. This took about five tries, but the ancient lock gave way. Even with the lock broken, the door was quite stuck, and required the combined efforts of three people for several minutes to open. Inside the dam building were two wheels of some sort of extremely interesting metal. Uvash didn't think it was dwarvish, but it looked to be in remarkably good shape for metal that had sat in a wet place for 1200 years. Vael immediately played with both wheels, and found that one spun freely and did nothing, and the other was very stuck and would not budge, but had ten marks on the side and seemed to currently be set around the middle. The stronger Vallium heaved mightily on the wheel and caused it to move a notch, and then the group went outside to see what that did to the dam.

While they did this, a huge flying reptile with a vicious barb on its tail flew toward the dam from the southwest, turned around high over the party, and unleashed a rather large clump of something gross from its nether regions. The improvised missile missed them and splashed into the lake nearby, and the flying beast flew away back to the west, apparently heading to the tower in the southwest corner of the ruins. The group briefly discussed what kind of beast that was and decided it was big enough to leave alone for now. They returned to the subject of the dam and decided the wheel somehow controlled the amount of water going through it, and Uvash suggested slowing the flow by one notch to see if that made the waterfall a bit less dangerous on the climb. Several minutes of exertion later the wheel was in that position. Vael decided to cast Seek Earth, looking for gold and silver. The spells both pointed southwest, the same direction the flying beast with the stinger had gone. The group decided today was not a good day to try to fight a huge flying reptile and take its treasure. They instead walked south to the top of the waterfall.

The guard tower flanking the east side of the waterfall was mostly fallen down, with only the ground floor intact. Remembering how Michael almost got ambushed by spiders last time, the group very cautiously examined the outside of the tower for a few minutes before Vallium peeked his head in, but they did not spot anything of interest this time. The group looked at the waterfall from the top for a bit, then decided to head back toward the Pyramid of Thoth.

After walking for several minutes, they reached the pyramid without encountering any surprises. Once again they said the four pictures of Thoth in various poses on the first four steps, and that the pictures repeated on the higher steps. After a bit of discussion of the pictures the group climbed to the top of the pyramid. There stood a 20' tall statue of Thoth in Ibis-headed form, with a body of purple porphyry stone and a head of white marble, with eyes of green jade. Curiously, while the body of the statue was massive, the arms looked relatively light and appeared to be mounted on pins so that they could rotate up and down. The pyramid was surrounded by purple porphyry columns, holding up a relatively small roof that protected the pyramid from the elements. Finally, one rectangular section of floor was a different color from the rest, and seemed to have a seam around it indicating that it might be able to move, but it sat flush and there were no handles visible so there was no obvious way to open it.

Taking a clue from the statue's spindly arms and the pictures on the lowest step, the group decided to move both arms forward. Sure enough, the door in the floor slid open, revealing some stairs heading down into the pyramid. There was a large handle on the bottom side of the door, showing it might be possible to slide it open from inside. The party tested that handle and confirmed they could indeed move the door using it, then headed down the steps into the pyramid.

After a long descent they saw a small landing where the stairs reversed to continue down in the other direction. All the original plaster on the walls was destroyed, and the bare walls were covered with graffiti in a variety of languages. Ioannes pointed out some graffiti in modern Archontean (surprising some) saying "I told Robin not to touch the eyes. Now his picks are mine." This seemed to confirm Uvash's earlier advice not to steal gem eyes from religious states because their gods don't like that.

After briefly discussing the graffiti, they continued down the next staircase until it emerged into larger landing room, this one with the remains of a fire pit, and lit by orange Continual Light cast on the ceiling. Why the Continual Light was orange, they were not sure. They searched the fire pit and just found some charcoal and bones, nothing interesting.

Continuing down the next flight of stairs, they descended hundreds of feet until the stairs ended in a large room, partially lit by torches in wall sconces, and containing another statue of Thoth. This one was 15' tall, with an open stone offering chest at its feet and movable arms like the statue on top of the pyramid. Glancing around the room for other items of interest, they found a recently dead human corpse against the west wall, with no armor or weapons but still wearing clothing. As they discussed the newly found statue and body, the group was interrupted by some high-pitched talk in Archontean. It was an armed and armored halfling, backed up by five more, walking toward them.

The lead halfling was named Roskelly, and he informed the party that this area under the pyramid was the turf of his boss, Phlebotomas Plumthorn, and that Mr. Plumthorn generously allowed visitors to their territory as long as they purchased an Adventuring License for $25, and also paid a tithe of 10% of any treasure recovered in the Halls. A conversation proceeded, where the PCs tried to figure out whether it was only these 6 halflings or whether they had backup, while the halflings tried to see if the PCs had the money, and whether they would pay, flee back up the stairs, or fight. The PCs told Roskelly they needed to go back up the steps a bit to confer in private, and return with their decision. After a prolonged discussion about whether to fight today or later when they knew more about their opposition, they reluctantly agreed to pay the toll, and handed Roskelly $125 in gold and silver coins. This caused Roskelly and his gang to relax noticably, and they issued five small bronze tokens that they said were the Adventuring Licenses and would allow re-entry. The pointed at the various exits from the room and indicated that the portcullis to the east was the halflings' territory and visitors weren't welcome that way, but they were free to explore anywhere else they wanted, and just to call out before they left to facilitate the smooth and businesslike paying of their tithe. The halflings then withdrew a bit toward their territory and left the party to figure out where to explore.

There was a body to search, another statue to check out, and a large room with a total of nine exits, or seven if they excluded the stairs they'd just come down and the halflings' territory. Vael searched the body, and found that while it had no weapons or armor or coins, there was a scroll in its pants pocket. He scanned the scroll, was happy to see that it appeared to be a spell scroll in Mithric, but then was disappointed that it was a cleric scroll rather than a mage scroll that he could use. It was See Secrets, useful for finding traps and secret doors, and it was a powered scroll that a cleric could use without burning their own mana. Vael handed the scroll to Ioannes.

The group briefly discussed doing something with the statue, then decided to go through the easternmost door on the north wall. It was unlocked, and some small footprints in the dust revealed that the halflings had probably gone that way before. A bit disappointed that the area had probably already been plundered, the party proceeded, hoping to reach fresh territory with loot. They opened another door, went down a narrow passage north, and found a larger room, lit with orange Continual Light like they had seen on the stairway landing. The walls were lined with sixteen pictures of ibis heads all looking at the same point in the center of the floor, but there was nothing interesting at that point. There were bronze double doors leading north, along with a couple of peepholes in the north wall, and a single wooden door to the west. The double doors were locked. The peepholes lead to a dark room. Vael shoved his Continual Light rock through a peephole to reveal a big empty dusty room with walls painted green. With the doors leading north locked and very strong looking, the group went west through the unlocked wooden door. This led to a bare stone passage, then another door leading to a corridor full of trash and with doors leaving in four directions. Using the maxim of "left for loot" they turned left to the south, went down another stone corridor, can emerged into another small room. This one had a rotted old pouch in one corner, which Ioannes searched. It contained a single silver coin and a small gem. "Left for loot" had worked again, though it wasn't a lot of loot.

There was another door on the south end of the room, and Vael predicted from his map that it would lead back into the room with the statue of Thoth, where the halflings had extracted the admission fees. It indeed did. The halflings came to check out the light and noise, saw it was repeat customers, and went back to their portcullis. This time the group decided to play with the statue. Ioannes put the coin he'd just found into the offering chest, but nothing happened. Vallium suggested adding the scroll they'd just found, but again nothing happened.

There were plenty of places left to check: five unknown exits from this room, two unexplored wooden doors back northwest, and the locked bronze doors to the northeast. They went northwest, and opened the left door. Beyond it was a big oval room, with four pillars helping to hold up the roof, each of them carved with the image of a different god. The two clerics conferred and pooled their theological knowledge and announced that three of the statues were Osiris, Wadjet, and Maat. The three non-clerics showed off the depth of their own theological knowledge by explaining that the fourth one with the ibis head was Thoth. There was an archway to the north with bright orange light coming through it, a dark archway to the west, and a passage heading south to a door. Vael said something about loot being more likely in dark places and also left for loot, so they went south.

This led to an intersection of wide hallways leading south and west, surrounded by looted empty burial niches along the walls. Far ahead to the south was another statue of Thoth, so the group went that way. This statue featured Thoth seated with a book in his lap and a pen in his hand. Again the arms could be moved. A passage to the east led back to the halfling area. After much discussion about the pictures on the stairs, Vael started playing with the arms. Pointing the left arm forward produced a click to the east that two of them heard, so the group went east to the room with the halflings, didn't see what clicked, and went back west. Vael also pointed the right arm forward, and then a pit opened up in front of the statue, where a couple of his friends had been standing a few minutes before. Nobody was standing there now, so nobody fell in. Vael, having lost his own Continual Light rock, called his friends who had light over to help look in the hole. Rather than a vertical pit, it was a chute, sloping down and east, and continuing past the range of the light. After a quick agreement not to go down right now, Vael resumed playing with the statue's arms. Resetting the arms to pointing down closed the lid to the chute with a thunk. Pointing both arms straight up reopened the chute and also 10' deep pits north and south of the statue, with spikes. Fortunately nobody was standing on either when they opened up.

Done opening pits for the monent, the group proceeded south to a closed door, then through the door to an east-west hallway full of an ugly greenish-gray mist. The mist didn't seem harmful. As they entered, an illusory mouth appeared on the opposite wall, said a few sentences in a language none of them understood, and disappeared. They thought they heard the word "Thoth", but otherwise it was gibberish. They proceed west and entered a large room containing a pyramid, this one triangular rather than square. Much smaller than the Pyramid of Thoth high above them, but pretty big for an indoor pyramid, tall enough that they couldn't see the top with their bright Continual Light stones. They discussed climbing it, but then Vael announced that they needed to head back to town soon and had hardly found any loot, so he should try another Seek Earth to see if there was any gold or silver nearby. After much agreement, he cast both spells, and thought he detected both gold and silver to the north. So they went east out of the pyramid room, back north to the hallway with looted burial niches, then turned west into another hallway, sloping down, of looted burial niches, where the spell seemed to point.

The group could have been surprised by giant rats jumping ouf of the niches to ambush them, but they were not. It was about a dozen rats, and they were actually slightly bigger than the halflings, if less heavily armed and armored. The loot apparently already had an owner. The rats charged toward the party. Vallium quickly killed one with his sword. Vael cast Grease on the floor under all the rats, causing much slipping and falling. While the rats were delayed, the rest of the group formed up to fight. Lasselanta stood ready to parry with her staves, and when the rats tried to bite her friends she aggressively knocked them back to slide across the magically slippery floor back to their nest. Meanwhile both clerics tried to get a couple of blows, but not very effectively, and Uvash actually dropped his mace. Vael walked up to prepare more spells, while Vallium killed several rats. Eventually Lasselanta thought the density of rats was low enough for her to go on the offensive as well, and started initiating attacks on the rats rather than waiting for them to attack and aggressively parrying. After a few seconds, there were about a dozen dead giant rats on the floor. The party was fortunately unwounded, as nobody knew what kind of diseases rats that size might carry, but probably nothing good.

There was a huge rats' nest in the corner where two niche-filled hallways connected. Vael quickly ran up to the next for loot, saw a rather ornate torch that look magic, and grabbed it. It was indeed magic, but as he grabbed it, the area around him went completely dark. Vael, holding the torch, couldn't see anything near him, but could see light outside the area. His friends nearby couldn't see anything. Vael tried throwing the torch away, but it clung to his hand. Oops. After some discussion, Vael retreated from his friends to let them see, while the rest of them searched the nest. The remaining treasure was all mundane shiny stuff: some gold and silver coins, several gems, a pearl, and a gold ring with a lapis inset. Depending on what the gems were worth, probably enough to make this delve worthwhile, even after the expense of paying off the halflings and presumably needing to donate to a temple to detach that cursed torch from Vael.

Taking advantage of the magical darkness, the group put all the gems on Vael where they were impossible to see and had Ioannes just carry the small number of coins they'd found. Most of the halflings found the story of the cursed torch amusing. But Roskelly wasn't sure he believed it, and had a couple of his thugs go into the darkness and try to separate Vael from the torch, which failed, and while the halflings were distracted by the torch and the darkness they failed to pat down Vael for the gems. Ioannes obediently paid $5 out of the $46 in coins they'd found.

The group headed back to Gosterwick. Vael had to stay about six yards away from his friends to let them see. It would have been a dangerous climb down the Long Stair for Vael, since he would be unable to see where he was stepping, but fortunately he had Levitation, so the cloud of darkness just floated down the side of the mountain while everyone else had to hike. There were no dangerous encounters on the way back, and, owing to their early morning start, they made it back to town right around sunset.


GM's Comments:

Another successful week. The PCs didn't pick up nearly as much loot as last time, but it was enough to pay their expenses for a week. They broke into an ancient dam and think they figured out how to manipulate the water level, which may be useful at some point. They saw a terrifyingly huge and rather rude flying reptile high above them, and decided not to go after the hoard that Seek Earth indicated it might be guarding. They figured out how to manipulate the statue to get into the Pyramid of Thoth, paid off some rent-seeking halflings, and found two more statues of Thoth, another pyramid, and a group of angry giant rats with some minor treasure. Finally, they found another amusingly cursed item, and this time found out about the curse the hard way.

The group was lucky not to be standing above any of the three pits they opened when playing with the seated statue. Two PCs had previously been standing atop the lid of the chute to the east, but when some playing with the statue's arms had produced a click to the east, everyone had walked that way to look for the source, and when they came back they didn't stand in the same place. The pits to the north and south looked like pretty simple traps: fall ten feet, land on spikes, bleed. Not fun at all, but probably not lethal for a tough PC with a friendly cleric or two nearby to patch them up. The one with a sloping chute leading down into the darkness, though, nobody could be sure about. Maybe it led to a soft landing and a pile of treasure; maybe it led to molten lava. One way to find out...

As with the spiders last week, the rats failing to surprise the party despite pretty good odds heavily influenced the combat. The group had two strong warriors to kill the rats and parry their bites, Vael's Grease spell to slow down the flow of rat attacks to a level the warriors could more easily handle, and the clerics to help distract the rats from dogpiling the warriors. Uvash missed a rat badly enough to accidentally throw his mace three hexes, demonstrating why four out of five warriors recommend a one-silver-piece lanyard for their friends who critically fail attack rolls. Fortunately the rats were mostly dead by that point so it didn't matter too much.


Achievements:

The statue of Thoth right under the pyramid (the one with the stone collection box, not the one with the book that opens pits when you play with the arms) is the Glory of Thoth, an Arden Vul Iconic Location. This group all got 1 XP for finding it, even though they hadn't heard of it before.


XP:

They haven't identified all the gems or the ring yet, or paid for the Remove Curse on that torch, but this delve will clearly end up in the 1 XP for loot range: enough to pay the bills but not enough to qualify as a great haul. The group explored about 20 new locations, which falls into the 1 XP for exploration range. And the Achievement was 1 XP. So everyone earned 3 XP, a solid week, especially when you consider they were in the red until the very end of the session.


Next week:

Presumably Vael needs a Remove Curse for that torch. The group has some gems and a ring to identify, and then they'll probably head back to the ruins. Possible points of interest include that giant rude flying reptile with the scary tail and possible loot to the southwest, the dam above the waterfall, the square tower they haven't entered yet, the unexplored majority of the ruins, or going back under the Pyramid of Thoth. Under the Pyramid they've got the triangular mini-pyramid to explore, some halflings they've vaguely discussed fighting to take their money back, and a whole bunch of unexplored ways to go.

Shopping in Gosterwick and the DFRPG Arden Vul Campaign
Some of my players seem to enjoy shopping for equipment a bit too much.  "What can we buy here?" is a common question.  Here's what they've visited so far in the town of Gosterwick:

Torunn the Smith.  Torunn, a large Wiskin woman, seems to be the best smith in town, or at least the best smith they've met.  She showed samples of good, fine, balanced, and dwarven weapons, and both good and fine armor, so it appears that she can produce high-quality items and has apprentices to do the more mundane work.  She only works with metal though; she doesn't do leather or wooden items.  In addition to selling weapons and armor, she was also willing to provide training in Armory and Connoisseur (Weapons).
Creon's Curios and Pawnshop.  Creon, an older Archontean man, has a shop full of random stuff.  He seems willing to buy used items.  His stock seems highly variable; he actually had a magic wand for sale the last time someone checked, but the price was high.
Jeremias the Money Changer.  Jeremias Smallleaf, a halfling, has his main shop in the walled Upper Market.  He also has a couple of smaller stalls in the Upper Market and near the Hill of the Gods, run by his daughters Marla and Cassie.  He was willing to identify old coins for free, and charges a small fee to change coins and gems.  It appears he also loans money, but the PCs have not yet discussed the terms.
Temple of Demma.  Ioannes is a cleric of Demma and so was able to negotiate a good donation rate for a Remove Curse spell there.  The Remove Curse was cast by Vivian, the Thorcin male chief priest of the temple; it's unclear whether any of the other four priests can cast spells that powerful.  It's not yet known what the surcharge is for non-members of the congregation without a cleric to vouch for them.  Training for clerical spells and skills is also available.
House of the Gods.  This is a shared space for shrines of all the approved religions that don't have full temples in town.  No major services are available, besides basic religious information from lay volunteers, or possibly the occasional chance to meet a visiting cleric.
The Yellow Cloak Inn.  This is a full-service inn, with both private rooms and shared bunkrooms, and both common and upper-class common rooms with a variety of food available.  It is run by Margot the Red, a Thorcin woman.  Her husband Bricwine is a bartender.  Rates for double-occupancy private rooms and common meals are reasonable; single-occupancy private rooms and better meals would increase the cost of living.  Margot does not allow spellcasting on the premises, because You Might Accidentally Summon a Demon.
The Arcane Practitioners' Club.  The club is not affiliated with any of the seven official Archontean colleges.  It is run by two Archontean women, Lyssandra (the senior wizard) and Pelteon (her former apprentice).  They offer magical training, identification of magic items, and spellcasting services.  Fee-paying members of their club can also use their alchemy lab, their small library, and even rent apartments.  (The apartments aren't quite as nice as the Yellow Cloak Inn, and no maid service or food is available, but there are fewer rules.)
The Baliff's Truncheon.  This is a dive bar down the hill from the Azure Keep, near Totey Lake.  It has a bad reputation, which means it's a good place to find trainers for less savory skills -- or possibly get robbed trying.
Livestock and Horse Market.  On the outskirts of town (but still within its theoretical future walls) is a large building that buys and sells and stables horses, and buys and sells livestock, and also butchers livestock and sells meat.  They also sell farming and mining equipment on the side.  It is said to be run by identical twin brothers, with Sakeon handling the horses and Trucleon the livestock.
Tasha's Tailor Shop.  Tasha, a Thorcin woman, has a high-end tailor shop in the Upper Market.  She sells various clothing and is also able to alter or repair clothes, or to sew clothing to order.  She aims at the higher end of the market; there are cheaper options in worse parts of town.
There are fishermen by the docks on Totey Lake.  One was willing to give swimming lessons, even in early spring.  Presumably you could also learn fishing or boating or knot-tying from them, and not be quite as cold.  There are also a couple of fishmongers to sell their catch.
And here are some other locations they've heard about but not actually visited:
Temples of Mitra, Lucreon, and Heschius Ban.
Astableon the Scribe and Bookseller.  This shop, located in the Upper Market, is apparently the place to go if you need to buy or sell a book, or have someone read or write a letter for you.
The Stunned Acolyte Inn.  This is where you get a very high-quality room or meal, if you don't mind paying a lot and dressing and behaving appropriately.
The Rarities Factor, the Prosperity Factor, and the Silent Factor.  Three competing Archontean merchant factors have buildings in town.  They provide financial services such as safely holding your money for a fee, letters of credit that let you access your stored money at their other locations, and organization of merchant caravans to transport goods or letters across the Empire.  They may provide other services as well.
The Azure Keep is home to the local sept of the Knights of the Azure Shield.  Lady Alexia Basileon, the Green Lady, lives in the Residence connected to the Keep.
There are at least four Archontean government buildings in town.
The Central Market is held twice a week, on Totsday morning and all Demmasday.  Some merchants and farmers who don't have full stores operate stalls at the market.
Kaelo's Bathhouse is apparently a major social center, not just a place to get clean.
There are about 7 more taverns.  Apparently getting a drink at every inn and tavern in town on the same night is a challenge among irresponsible young people with money to spend, and the hardest part is getting into the Stunned Acolyte.
There are other craftspeople such as leatherworkers, jewelers, stonecutters, potters, weavers, furriers, a bowyer, a herbalist/apothecary, and a ropemaker.

What does this all mean in game terms?
All standard equipment from DFRPG: Adventurers (not Special Orders or magic items or Elven/Dwarven equipment) is available at list price.  (Except plate armor, which is unknown in the Archontean Empire.)  No interaction with the GM is required here; if you want a normal knife or wheelbarrow you can just buy one.
High quality versions of standard equipment are also available, but might require some lead time for custom construction.  So if you're in a hurry, first make an availability roll to see if what you want is available off the shelf.  And if it's not, see how long it will take to make one.
The pawnshop buys used items, so disposing of unwanted goods (at the usual fraction of their value based on Wealth) is easy.  No interaction with the GM is required to sell most used goods.  If something is very valuable ($5000 or more), the sale should be cleared with the GM to make sure the local merchants can afford it.
Special Orders or magical equipment might be available, but not reliably.  You're either waiting for something to show up for sale somewhere, or finding someone who can make it for you.  Again, the GM will make an availability roll, and if it fails you can try again next week, or see if someone can make your item.
What about other towns or cities?
The only bigger town in Burdock's Valley is Newmarket, about 60 miles (three days' walk) to the south.  It's about twice as big as Gosterwick, so a bit more robust of a market, but still not exactly huge.
The only real city in this part of Irthuin is Narsileon, the capital of the Exarchate.  Narsileon is about twenty times as big as Gosterwick and ten times as big as Newmarket, and is also a seaport with access to wider trade routes, so has much more available.  Unfortunately it's about 400 miles away, which is two to three weeks each way on foot, or a bit faster if you have horses.
The biggest city in the Empire and the known world is the capital, Archontos, on the island of Mithruin.  It's about three times the size of Narsileon.  If you can buy something at all, you can probably buy it in Archontos.  Getting there means first travelling to Narsileon, then catching a ship and sailing 1100 miles across the Winedark Sea.  The ocean voyage should take about a week if the winds are cooperative, or potentially longer if they're not.

# DFRPG Arden Vul Session 20: The Outer Caverns of Set

Date: 

Basilsday, 26th of Masporios, 2993 AE 


Weather: 

Hot, dry


Player Characters: 

Uvash Edzuson, Dwarven cleric of Zodarrim (Cosmo)
Vael Sunshadow, Half-Elven mage (Kyle)
Vallium Halcyon, Archontean fighter (Greybrown)
Ioannes Grammatikos Byzantios, Archontean cleric of Demma (Demented Avenger)
Ashe "GOAT" Maykum, Goblin mercenary druid (ArchonShiva)


Significant NPCs:

Creon, pawnbroker
Egrk, caveman
Many other cave people
6 small chasm cephalopods
8 giant boring beetles
8 huge spiders
1 roper
Several unseen humans, including a female human fighter
Summoned manta rays, bat swarms, goats, boars, and warhorses


Vael suggested pushing the group's weekly delves into Arden Vul back a day, from Demmasday to Basilsday, to give an opportunity to shop at Gosterwick's Demmasday market, the biggest of the week.  Everyone agreed, but none of the peddlers at the market this week had anything very exciting for sale.  Vael did find some Delver's Webbing at Creon's Curios, and paid Creon to be notified of any new interesting items that came in before they went on the shop floor.

Michael was off in the woods somewhere, so the Right for Riches company hired the Grudge Brigade mercenary on call, the goblin druid GOAT.  GOAT brought along his recent invention, the Living Wheelbarrow, a wooden wheelbarrow containing enough living plant material that it could be affected by the Levitation spell.  He showed his creation to Vael, who immediately bought one.

The group set out early on Basilsday morning, confusing the gate guards who were used to seeing them every Demmasday.  They approached the waterfall without seeing anything of note, and took the small bridge over the Swift River about a mile south of the falls, to check out the west side of the cliffs and see if they could find Egrk's people.  After a bit of hiking they found a large cave at the base of a cliff, with a couple of primitively dressed warriors with spears standing guard outside.  After some rather unfriendly grunts, some more warriors came out of the cave, one of whom spoke a bit of Thorcin.  After a mention of Egrk's name, someone went to get Egrk.  Ioannes cast Gift of Tongues to enable fluent communication, and explained to Egrk that they were interested in trading for information.  Egrk talked to an older cave person and then said they needed metal weapons, metal tools and (after a female yell from inside the cave) some metal cooking pots.  The party said they'd bring metal stuff to trade next time, and asked if they could have any information now.  Since they had previously rescued him from being baboon chow, Egrk relented and pointed out a few spots on the cliff face.  He pointed at one spot halfway up the cliff and said that both the snake men and the lizard people came out of that one.  He pointed far across the waterfall and said the barking dogs came out of the entrance over there.  He then pointed back to the south and said the blue knights on big horses came from that way, and were jerks.

After the spell expired and communication became difficult again, the party waved goodbye and headed back east toward the waterfall.  Since they had GOAT along, they decided to go behind the waterfall again.  Vael first used Shape Earth to make a hole in the side of the cliff for the wheelbarrow and closed it up again.  GOAT summoned two large manta rays to tow people, and cast Swim and Breathe Water on someone, while Vael had a Ring of Free Action that let him move through water rapidly.  Using the combination of manta rays and magic, the group ran or swam or were towed through the tunnels behind the waterfall, emerging in the grotto.  After a pause for breath, they submerged again and went up some stairs to the north into the dry halls.

Vallium wanted to check out some stairs to the west.  GOAT dismissed the manta rays and summoned some goats and boars and bats, and then the whole group went west to a broken door.  Vallium pulled out his platinum token of Arden and inserted it into a slot next to the broken door, which didn't have any visible effect because the door was already smashed.  They proceeded past a statue of Arden with huge hammers in both hands, surrounded by smashed (and previously looted) corpses.  The statue did not animate.  They went out a door to the north, then started up the stairway up that they had previously found but not explored.

Vael cast Levitation on himself, and everyone else started trudging up the stairs.  When the stairs finally ended after about 700 feet, they emerged into a large circular room that was once tiled in blue and was currently partially tiled in blue and full of fallen blue tiles on the floor.  There was a large magical octagonal pillar in the center of the room, with bas reliefs carved on most of the sides:
A handsome man with a neat beard, with empty spherical eye sockets
A stereotypically Archontean looking middle aged woman, with large empty disc-shaped eye sockets
A monstrous-looking creature that resembled Gog, with an open oval-shaped mouth
A caricature of a priest of Thoth, with small empty disc-shaped eye sockets
A goblin with a large hole where its missing nose should be
Vallium had some small gold grooved discs that he hoped might match one of the holes, but they did not.  Everyone went through their small items looking for anything that was an obvious match, but nobody had anything that looked like an obviously good fit.  Someone suggested bringing different kinds of coins and gems next time.

After abandoning the pillar, they explored west but hit a dead-end caved in passage.  They then went south and heard some giant rats scampering ahead.  The cave to the south had a couple of smaller natural pillars, one with some stuff on top.  Vael levitated up and looked at some spikes and ropes and poles without taking them, then noticed and took a healing scroll.  They headed northwest through more rough passages and saw a worked floor to the north.  There was some kind of magical force field blocking entrance to a room to the west, so Vael used Shape Earth to dig a small hole around it, and GOAT went in.  He saw a large basket, a bunch of rope, and a few crates of weapons with Imperial seals.  He opened the crates and found some shortswords, spears, and knives, all of which the group took.  Vael decided to sabotage the ropes, attempting to disguise the damage so that some Set cultist might find out about it by the rope snapping at an inconvenient moment.

Vael sealed up the ends of the tunnel into the storage room, and then the group continued north and saw two statues flanking some stairs leading up and north.  Ioannes and Uvash agreed the statues were Set.  Vallium thought the exit to the cliff might be that way, but Vael (who claimed to have Absolute Direction) said the exit would be to the south.   So rather than going up the stairs, they turned around and went back south, then west.  They found a skeleton with two magic wands, one of them a broken Settite Was stick and the other unknown.  They took both for later investigation and then went south to a chasm, deeper than their Continual Light illiminated.  With Levitation still on, Vael flew out into the chasm to investigate, but saw several small Chasm Cephalopods flying up from below to greet him.  He yelled a warning and flew back north to the others.  A short fight ensued, with the cephaolopods losing, but taking some bat swarms with them.

Deciding that exploring the small chasm solo wasn't the safest idea, they doubled back and returned to the room where they'd found the gear on top of the pillar.  From there they headed south, and saw some bright natural light ahead.  They also spotted a small passage heading east.  They went to the exit and saw a chest containing another large basket along with ropes, pulleys, and red signal lanterns.  They looked out to get an idea of where they were on the cliff face, then Vael decided to sabotage some more ropes.

Heading back into the cave, the group went east down a short passage, filled with slippery purple fungus.  GOAT used his naturalist skills and an Identify Plant spell to ascertain that this was indeed slippery purple fungus, with Mithric name Fungus Slippius Violetus, edible but with no known medicinal uses.  They sat down to rest, but their rest was quickly interrupted by a giant beetle coming to investigate.  It was hungry enough to attack, so a fight broke out.  Seven more beetles joined the fight, but the beetles lost.  There was some discussion of trying to fashion armor out of beetle carapace, so Vallium tried removing some large chunks from one beetle corpse, but didn't do a very neat job of it and ended up with a bunch of small chunks.  GOAT looked closely at the beetles to see if they were natural animals that he might be able to summon in the future, but they were unnatural.

They spotted a hole in the floor, too deep to see the bottom.  Vael dropped a glowing rock into the hole and saw a finished floor about 35' below, covered with more purple fungus.  A minute later, another large beetle appeared to investigate the glowing stone.  They decided not to go down into the hole and face more beetles.  Vael decided they weren't finding treasure fast enough, so he cast Seek Earth looking for platinum, and thought there was some about 15 yards to the northeast.

After some rest, they headed east through some more caves, and GOAT spotted a huge spider staring at him with too many eyes.  As the goblin jumped back, the spider and several of its friends advanced.  Another fight ensued, though the spiders were squisher than the beetles so it didn't last as long.  Uvash got bitten at one point, but fortunately the mandibles did not penetrate his armor, so his poison resistance was not tested.  When all the spiders were dead, GOAT checked to see if the spiders were summonable animals, and was again disappointed to find that they were unnatural.

Vallium, who had borrowed the Ring of Free Action from Vael at some point, waded through the spider webs looking for treasure, and found several corpses (3 human and 3 lizardfolk) wrapped up in webs.  He passed the bodies out to the others for investigation and kept sifting through the webs.  The total take was a few coins, a small soapstone idol, some red Set scale armor, a shortsword, and a letter about someone named Theskelon, with an addendum in different handwriting about his tomb.

After resting, they headed north then west and found a large cavern, with a lot of stalactites and stalagmites, a magical mosaic on one wall depicting a bridge, and a few fresh corpses, one of them half eaten.  While investigating, Vallium felt some sticky ropes hitting him from above, then a large creature dropping and biting him.  The bite was vicious, but Vallium's thick scale armor protected him enough that he was still able to fight back.  The ropes didn't stick because of the Ring of Free Action.  Vallium yelled a warning, and everyone else eventually focused and joined the fight.  The roper attempted to rope Vallum a couple more times before being certain that he was unnaturally slippery and unropeable.  By then Vallium had stabbed it a couple of times, and the roper decided to leave and find an easier lunch.  Vael cast Great Haste on Vallium, enabling him to chase down the roper.  Meanwhile, GOAT summoned a heavy warhorse and sent it stampeding into the monster.  The roper was knocked down and stunned, just in time for Vallium to catch up and stab it several times.  The roper killed the summoned horse, so GOAT summoned another one, but it wasn't needed, as Vallium killed the roper before the cavalry arrived.

Vael thought there were about where the platinum should be, but didn't see any, so he cast Seek Earth again, which said the platinum was inside the roper corpse.  At that point they dissected the beast, and found one huge ancient octagonal platinum coin, along with several gems and a magic ring.  While Vallium and Vael rested, the rest of the group kept chopping up the roper hoping for more treasure, but eventually gave up.

There was a worked passage heading west, blocked by a cave-in.  Vael decided to use Shape Earth to dig a tunnel through the cave-in.  As the tunnel broke through, they heard voices from the other side, yelling for Gordy and Quade to stand guard, and a lot of noise.  Not wanting to get ambushed, Vael made a large Concussion missile and threw it through the hole, and then GOAT sent in a couple of bat swarms to clean up.  A few minutes later, they went through the hole, and found one freshly dead female fighter (with bleeding ears and a fatal number of bat bites) and a lot of dead bats.  There was an interesting (but immovable) frieze of a Settite scene on one wall, and a pile of heavy loot.  The rest of whoever had been there were gone.  They looted the body, and then went through the pile of stuff to find several packs of bulk food, a couple of casks of brandy, a few pelts (one of them surprisingly enchanted!) and a heavy carpet.

They grabbed all the loot and got ready to head back to Gosterwick.  Leaving the room to the west, Vallium spotted a tripwire on the floor, and did not trigger it.  Given a choice between just taking the basket down or climbing down 700' of stairs then going underwater, they decided to take the basket.  However, Vael had sabotaged the ropes, so they first had to repair the ropes.  Once they thought the ropes were sturdy enough, they lowered two people at a time down in the basket, and finally Vael levitated himself down the cliff face.  They dug the wheelbarrow back out of the cliff and used it to bring the pile of loot back home.

GM's Comments:
Vael started the session wearing the Ring of Free Action, but he passed it to Vallium when they reached the slippery purple fungus (because Vael was Levitating so wasn't worried about bad footing).  Vallium was very lucky he was wearing that ring when the roper randomly chose him as the victim, because all the binding rope attacks automatically failed.

Other than the roper, nothing else surprised the party despite their noise and bright lights.  The saw both the beetles and spiders in time to defend themselves, and they were the ones who dug through a caved-in wall, scared whoever was on the other side, and killed their rear guard.

I was amused when they sabotaged both the basket and backup basket, and then decided the basket was the best way home.  Planning!  However, knowing that something is sabotaged and exactly how is a good first step to repairing the damage, so nobody fell.  (They were one critical failure away from the repair failing, but they thought of that possibility and sent the GOAT, who had Levitate, first.)


Achievements:

None

XP:
Exploration:  20 new locations, good for 2 XP.
Loot: No really amazing items but a lot of stuff, 2 XP.
Achievements: 0
Total: 4 XP

Next week:

I have no idea where they are going, and neither do they.   They discuss it a bit during the week, make no clear plan, and then wing it at the last minute.

At this point they've found the following areas:
Surface Ruins of Arden Vul
Basement (they think they have probably fully explored this)
Well of Light
Howling Caves
Halls of Thoth
Great Cavern
Caves presumably leading to the Forum of Set
Gog's Cave
Bottom of Privy Shaft
Caves behind the waterfall
They also have the Scorpion Teleporter, which they have used 3 times and ended up in 3 places.

# DFRPG Arden Vul Session 21: The Library of Thoth

Date: 

Basilsday, 2nd of Gerakios, 2993 AE 


Weather: 

Cool, dry


Player Characters: 

Uvash Edzuson, Dwarven cleric of Zodarrim (Cosmo)
Vael Sunshadow, Half-Elven mage (Kyle)
Vallium Halcyon, Archontean fighter (Greybrown)
Ioannes Grammatikos Byzantios, Archontean cleric of Demma (Demented Avenger)
Sister Valya "Basilisk" Hushbreaker, Halfling mercenary monk (ArchonShiva)


Significant NPCs:

Giant lizard
Many large albino baboons
Isocritis Half-Hand, Archontean wizard
6 baboon zombies
8 logovores
Magically animated head of Stamelis, Librarian of Thoth
Umsko, giant 4-armed intelligent baboon
Yamki, giant 4-armed intelligent baboon
Thalia, Thorcin ranger
Fetch, elderly Archontean slave prisoner


In Gosterwick, Vael paid Creon the pawnbroker to let him know about any particularly interesting items before putting them up for general sale.  Creon let Vael know about a Wand of Air Jet that came in, but Vael declined to buy it.  More graffiti appeared on the town walls, in a slightly different style than the previous graffiti, this time depicting some chickens killing a huge red dragon, then running from tiny halflings.  Vael and Uvash went to the Demmasday market looking for Elven and Dwarven rations.  Neither found what they were looking for, but Octavian's Cucina had some Arden Vul Cakes available, which Vael purchased.  Nobody was quite sure of the origin of the cakes, except that they were occasionally found in the ruins of Arden Vul, were highly nutritious if not very tasty, and lasted forever if kept dry.

Vallium, newly nominated as the Right for Riches Company's official destination planner, decided that they would go down the Well of Light and look for the Library of Thoth.  With Michael still off in the mountains somewhere, they hired Basilisk, the tiny halfling monk with the piercing high-pitched kiai shout.  As usual, Basilisk asked to ride on someone's shoulder rather than walking all the way to Arden Vul on her very short legs.  When they reached the Long Stair, however, she somehow walked right up the side of the cliff.  Vael Levitated, and everyone else climbed up the steep and treacherous path the regular way, without incident.

As they walked north through the ruins of Arden Vul, a giant lizard attempted to ambush them from behind a tree.  Its attempt at surprise failed, and Vallium stabbed it.  Noting the lizard's thick hide might be useful, Vallium skinned it, and Vael used his Levitation to carry the hide up and stow it in the top of a tree.

Continuing north into the Forum of Arden Vul, Vael expressed suspicion about the giant oak tree growing out of the center of the ruined pavement.  Ioannes took a close look at the tree and said it was really old, but looked like a regular oak to him.  Uvash climbed the tree and didn't see anything odd.

As they reached the Well of Light, Vael first dropped several very bright Continual Light stones down the well to try to scare away light-averse baboons.  He then cast Flight on Vallium, who could carry Ioannes then Uvash down the Well.  Vael Levitated down, while Basilisk walked down the side of the well, but both were much slower than Vallium's Flight.  Ioannes, alone at the bottom of the Well, heard the loud hooting of baboons to the east.  He raised his shield and waited, until Vallium returned carrying Uvash.  The three then saw four baboons charge.  Vallium, with Flight still active, counter-charged and shield rushed one, but failed to knock it over.  The four baboons tried to swarm him, as Uvash and Ioannes ran up to help, but Vallium's thick scale armor kept him from getting hurt as he crippled one baboon and knocked another unconscious.  The survivors broke and ran, and nobody pursued, as they waited for Vael and Basilisk to arrive.

Once the group was together and the baboons were out of earshot, they went due south toward where they thought the Library was.  They saw some double doors at the end of the passage.  Everyone listened at the doors, but nobody heard anything.  Vallium went through his collection of keys, and one of them (which had been taken from Gerrilad) unlocked the door.  Opening the door, they saw a Continually Lit library, with 6 hooded figures seated at some nearby tables, a human in robes with one withered hand sitting at a librarian's table in the center of the room, then a row of pillars across the room, and some stacks of shelves filling the southern part.

The robed human gestured for silence and then whispered "Who are you and why are you in my library?"  Vael and Ioannes were not very happy that this guy claimed to own the library, and Ioannes failed to whisper his reply, so the man gestured toward the doors and indicated that they should continue their conversation outside.  When they got near the door he made it clear that he was an wizard, and that this was his library because Gerrilad, the owner of this level, gave it to him.  Vael and Vallium countered that they had killed Gerrilad, so it was their level and their library now.  The man said that, despite that, he was an archmage and they were not and if they did not leave he would have to demonstrate his powers.  Vael took affront and Blinked behind the man, then tapped him on the shoulder.  At that point a potentially fatal electrical shock moved from the wizard's shoulder to Vael's hand, but Vael's Bless spell caused his hand to jerk away supernaturally quickly, as a bolt of lightning arced to the floor instead.

Isocritis the wizard, affronted that he had been flanked and also that Vael had cheated by bringing divine assistance to a wizard fight, waved to his allies sitting around the tables, and the robed forms revealed themselves to be zombified baboons as they scampered to his assistance on all fours.  However, Vallium was directly behind Isocritis, and took advantage of the opportunity by shoving the blade of his broadsword into the kidneys of the wizard while he was distracted by Vael.  Isocritis's spellcasting ability failed to protect him from the mighty stab, and he collapsed, dead.

One of the baboon zombies tried to punch Vael, who Blinked back to the other side of the doors, out of reach.  Vallium, standing in the doorway, started stabbing any zombie within reach.  Uvash and Ioannes both stayed behind the doorway.  8 creatures that looked like baby baboons, who had been hiding within the stacks south of the pillars, ran forward, with one of them yelling "Need New!"

When he recovered from the disorientation of Blinking, Vael cast Grease inside the doorway.  He followed this up with Create Fire in another area, after making sure there were no books there.  The Grease and Fire channeled his allies as much as they did the enemies, though, and Ioannes and Uvash remained stuck behind Vallium.  Basilisk, with her wall-walking ability, suffered no such constraints, as she walked along the wall over the fire, throwing flash nageteppos, then a smoke nageteppo, and continually shouting stunning kiais at the nearest targets, to both stop them from attacking and make them more vulnerable.

As the baboons gradually went down, Ioannes went into the east side of the room around the fire, while Uvash crawled over the Grease into the west side.  The baby baboons kept yelling "Known!" and "Need New!" as they adorably tried to kill everyone.  There was some speculation about what the baboons wanted.  Vael tried speaking Elvish, and the baboons liked that a lot, and all grew a bit bigger.  Fortunately for the Left for Loot Company, the baby baboons didn't have time to get too big before they were all dead.  One of them landed a solid claw hit on Ioannes, but otherwise the party was uninjured.

With the fight over, the group started looting the wizard's body and then searching the room.  There were hundreds or even thousands of books in the stacks, so a thorough search would take forever.  Vael suggested locking the doors and searching until they were done, but Ioannes wanted to go grab the statue head of Stamelis the Librarian and bring him to the library.  The group went east to Gerrilad's quarters were Stamelis was, and while they were there they stuck Isocritis's body in the mulch pit.  Vallium dragged the heavy bust back to the library and set it in a place of honor on the librarian's station.

Ioannes then had a conversation with Stamelis, while Vael searched for secret doors, and Uvash started going through the stacks looking for interesting books.  In addition to the books, Uvash found a large mirror, which appeared to be related to the Well of Light.  Eventually they decided they should go find more treasure, and Vael cast Seek Earth for platinum, which showed there was some platinum a bit northeast.  He then tried finding gold, but the nearest gold was down a level.  He then cast Seek Magic, which revealed some magic in the stacks.  He went and found Isocritis's spellbook.  He tried Seek Magic again and found another spellbook, this one belonging to Tresti Iredell, the half-elven mage they had rescued from Gerrilad's prison.  Not wanting to keep burning expensive spells, Vael went through the stacks looking for more magic books, but failed to find any.  He tried Seek Magic one more time and the nearest magic was a bit to the southeast.  That did not jibe with their map, so they thought there was probably a secret door somewhere.

Heading northeast toward the platinum, the group found a room containing a statue of a baboon.  There was a passage heading south, and they heard the hooting of baboons that way.  They also heard the deeper grunts of giant baboons, giving commands.  They spent a few seconds casting spells to prepare for a combat, then they saw two giant baboons charging toward them from the south, followed by a mass of smaller baboons.

Vael cast Create Fire in the middle of the pack of smaller baboons to split the baboons in half and prevent more reinforcements from arriving.  That left 2 huge and 3 normal-sized baboons still in the fight.  Vallium chopped an arm off Yamki, one of the huge ones, as Basilisk used kiai to stun him.  Yamki realized he had been defeated, and surrendered.  This enraged the other huge baboon, Umsko, who slammed into Yamki from behind in frustration, then charged.  Uvash dodged and parried Umsko's attacks, then Basilisk stunned him.  With both nearby opponents stunned, Uvash made a huge all-out attack targeted at Umsko's skull, connected cleanly, and killed the giant baboon.  That caused all the baboons north of the wall of fire to stop fighting.

Some negotiation commenced with Yamki.  Vael's main argument was that all the baboons could die, or they could peacefully let the party have the run of the level and take whatever treasure they wanted, and the baboons could live and even be provided with food.  Yamki was badly wounded, though, and passed out before the negotiation reached a conclusion.  Uvash bandaged the giant baboon to keep him from bleeding to death, and then the group searched the room to the east.

In the room was a naked human woman, chained to the wall, trying to free herself from her shackles.  Vallium called Vael over asking for a Lockmaster spell, but the woman indicated that Umsko had the key, so they went back to Umsko's body and searched it, then used the key they found.  The woman crawled under a bed and pulled out a lot of equipment that she said was hers, and then hurriedly put on some clothes and some scale armor and started picking up weapons.  She said her name was Thalia, that she was a ranger, and that this was her gear.  She thanked them for freeing her, and said she had a lot of baboons to kill.  They informed her that Umsko was already dead, which calmed her down a bit.  She thanked Uvash for killing Umsko, and managed to not charge through the fire into the remaining masses of baboons to the south.

Thalia found a few other things under the bed that she said were not hers, and threw a scroll case to Vael, and pointed Vallium at a sack (which contained the platinum coins that Vael had detected, as well as some gold) and some potions.  With Umsko's room looted, they crossed the hall to Yamki's room, where they found a heavy ebony chair, which Vael judged as not valuable enough to be worth its weight.  They also found a silver goblet and a small wooden box containing silver coins, a potion, and a magic pebble.  Remembering a previous magic pebble, Vael said to avoid touching the pebble until it was identified, and Vallium just took the whole box.  A pile of rags in the corner surprisingly contained something magical, and Vael pulled out a magic cloak and added it to the loot pile.

There was one more door in the passage, which led to a storeroom.  Inside was an old human man, who was chained to the floor, and cowering at their approach.  Vallium tried Umsko's key again, and it worked.  The man was not thrilled to be freed, and didn't seem to speak Archontean.  He hooted a bit and hid in the corner, then tried running for the door at record-slow speed.  Vallium grabbed the old man, determined to rescue him rather than letting him run off and get killed.  The room was full of various things that the baboons ate, most of which were in no way appetizing to humans, so they didn't take any of them.  But when looking behind some crates, Ioannes spotted a magic bullwhip on the floor, and grabbed it.

At that point the party decided to head for home.  They went north and west back to the Well of Light, then went into the library to see if the mirror fit into the Well.  It did, but they put it back in the Library for now, because they could lock the doors.  Vael once again cast Flight on Vallium, and he ferried most of the others up the Well, in addition to Thalia and the old man.  When they got back to Gosterwick, Vallium took the old man to the Temple of Mitra, who told him that the man's name was Fetch and he had apparently been a slave to the baboons for most of his life, and didn't know many words in any human language.


GM's Comments:


Neither of the random encounters I rolled, the giant lizard or the troop of 4 baboons, were much of a challenge.  I thought the baboons might be a challenge since they attacked when the party was split while moving down the well, but Vallium had too much armor for the baboons to easily hurt him.

Isocritis was a challenge, and he might have killed Vael except for the Bless spell.  But he got himself surrounded, and a surrounded wizard is in deep trouble.  He probably should have stayed behind his baboon zombies, but he was trying to keep the invaders quiet to keep them from making the logovores grow.  With hindsight maybe he should have had a long, loud conversation instead, so that when the logovores appeared they were huge, but he was overconfident.

The logovores were a really neat monster, and the players eventually figured out how they worked (they grow when they hear enough new words) based on the monster name (leaked by Foundry VTT; maybe I need to find a way to avoid showing token names) and the "Known!  Need New!" and the way they grew after Vael spoke Elvish.  But between Basilisk's stunning and Vallium's stabbing, they didn't last long enough to grow to be a real threat.

The 4-armed giant baboons are tough except most of them are too overconfident to use weapons.  Fighting with your bare hands without the Striker advantage is a good way to get your arm cut off by an aggressive parry on your own attack.  If Gerrilad had just taught them to use giant clubs they might have killed a couple of PCs by now.  This is one of the challenges of converting D&D monsters to GURPS; sometimes the flavor carries over but the power level changes.

With more baboons defeated, we'll see if the PCs have the run of the Well of Light level, or if there are still enough baboons willing to fight for their territory.


Achievements:

The Rescuers: 1 XP for rescuing Thalia from Umsko.

XP:
Exploration: 5 new locations, good for 1 XP
Loot: Isocritis's and Yamki's and Umsko's stuff.  Not a huge amount, but enough for 1 XP
Achievements: 1 XP
Total: 3 XP

Next Week:
I expect they'll come back to the Well of Light and try to finish searching the Library or play with the mirrors or explore more.  But every time I expect them to focus on the same job for two weeks in a row they surprise me, so we'll see.

# DFRPG Arden Vul Session 22: The Oracle of Thoth and The Litany of Light

Date: 
Basilsday, 9nd of Gerakios, 2993 AE 


Weather: 

Hot, dry


Player Characters: 

Vael Sunshadow, Half-Elven mage (Kyle)
Vallium Halcyon, Archontean fighter (Greybrown)
Ioannes Grammatikos Byzantios, Archontean cleric of Demma (Demented Avenger)
Merenuithiel "Lacrymosa" Armaris, Elven mercenary archer (Archon Shiva)


Significant NPCs:

6 ghouls
Yamki, wounded giant 4-armed intelligent baboon
Many large albino baboons
Anaximander, ancient insane cleric of Mitra
Voice of Thoth, ancient god for magic, moons, secrets, etc.
Skeleton cook
Flaming skull
Animated bust of Stamelis, Librarian of Thoth
2 Ibis constructs of Thoth


Ioannes did some research on the copy of the Litany of Light they had found in the Library of Thoth, which pointed to it being a forgery, so he wasn't sure if it was a good idea.  Vael learned the location spells Seeker, Pathfinder, and Trace, and tried using them to find the Troll Lifts and Lillian the missing cleric of Mitra.  Vallium tried and failed to find some magic scale armor, and decided not to put down a deposit on fine-quality scale armor.

Vallium decided the company should try to finish exploring the Well of Light level (except the caves full of baboons), try installing the mirror below the Well of Light, and have Ioannes conduct the Litany of Light if willing and able.  Michael was still off in the mountains somewhere and Uvash had a church emergency, so the shorthanded party hired Lacrymosa the bloodthirsty elf archer.  She asked if it was time to kill the halflings yet, then came along to kill whatever else they needed her to kill.

They got up early on a sunny Basilsday, made good time to the cliff face beneath Arden Vul, then tied themselves together and climbed up the Long Stair (except Vael, who didn't believe in climbing when you could Levitate).  They made it to the top without any problems and hiked to the top of the Well of Light.  Vael cast Flight on Vallium, who carried Ioannes down the Well, while Vael Levitated down and Lacrymosa used Walk on Air to walk down the well as if there were an invisible spiral staircase.  This time, there were no baboon hordes waiting for them at the bottom, so they were able to rest safely.

They went west, then north, and found a door that was spiked shut.  They prepared for battle and Vallium ripped the spikes out.  Opening the door revealed 6 angry ghouls.  A quick fight ensued, where Vallium stabbed the ghouls, Lacrymosa show the ghouls, Ioannes finished off one ghoul with his axe, and Vael supervised while preparing a Great Haste spell just in case they needed it.  They did not.  Digging through the trash in the room found a few platinum coins, a tall bronze magic helmet shaped like an inverted flowerpot, and a wand.  They grabbed the treasure, unspiked a second door into the room for good measure, then continued exploring north and west.

Eventually they doubled back and explored south and west.  They found an empty room, then a room with Continual Light, a fresco of an ibis with orange glowing eyes, a scroll along the wall full of obscure phrases in Mithric, and three blocks of granite shaped like open mouths, with black holes of magical darkness.  They explored the room for a while, until the ibis's eyes flashed and a burst of energy filled the chamber, dispelling all their spells (including all their Blesses, all their Continual Light rocks, and Vael's Levitation) and destroying some of their potions.

After depositing their surviving potions outside the room in case that reoccurred, Vael cast a Light spell into the air, then cast Trace on his Returning Pebble and threw it into the eastern mouth.  He sensed that it teleported way down and northeast, then was still.  A few minutes later, the dispelling effect repeated, taking out both the Light and the Trace.  The Returning Pebble eventually returned, and Vael returned the experiment with the middle mouth.  This time the pebble went down and in the direction he threw it, as if there were stairs or a ramp there.  He waited until the second Trace was dispelled and the Pebble reappeared in his pocket, then returned the experiment with the western mouth.  This one seemed like another teleporter, moving the stone down and southeast.

Meanwhile, Ioannes, re-cast Bless on his other companions, who stayed out of the room to keep from having it dispelled again.  He finally cast it on Vael, and then everyone crawled into the magical mouth.  After going through a brief area of magical Darkness and Silence, they emerged onto narrow stairs leading down, then the passage turned west and they went down some more, until they reached a dead end with a square hole in the ceiling.  Vael re-cast Levitation and popped up into a hemispherical room containing an dais with a magical marble chair and a ibis statue whose wings wrapped around the chair.  In the chair sat a very old, disheveled man who was twitching and mumbling.

Everyone climbed up into the room.  The man did not respond.  Everyone tried talking to him, but he did not respond.  Eventually Vallium pulled the man out of the chair, and then the man noticed them, but did not speak coherently, just babbled about things they mostly did not understand.  It took a lot of prodding to reveal that his name was Anaximander, he was a cleric of Mitra, and he'd been in that chair for a very long time.  Ioannes told the others to pull him out if anything weird happened, then sat in the chair.  He felt a warm layer of air, then a deep voice told him to "Speak Thy Desire."  Ioannes said that he wanted to know the correct way to perform the Litany of Light.  The voice told him that he already had a book that said exactly how to do it, and that instructions could not get much more detailed that that, but maybe he could find a version with more pictures.  Ioannes was then stunned.  After a couple of minutes, Vallium pulled Ioannes out of the chair, and he soon recovered.

The old guy asked a few jealous questions about how Ioannes had gotten answers and said maybe it was a good idea to bring friends along to pull him out of the chair.  While he rocked on the floor, the group went out an exit to the south, into a room with a magic pool, whose water was overflowing the basin and streaming out of the room to the southeast.  Vael cast Analyze Magic, which said that the pool was designed to increase its user's intelligence.  That was enough for Ioannes, who immediately took a drink and felt smarter.  Impressed, Vael also took a drink, but felt sicker rather than smarter, then felt his guts twisting.  Ioannes cast a couple of Stop Bleeding spells and a Major Healing on Vael to help repair the damage, and the poisoning eventually subsided.  Vallium explored the water damage crack, but it wasn't big enough to go far, and he didn't find anything in the water.

Returning to the Oracle room, the group grabbed Anaximander and headed back up the stairs.  They left the dispelling room before it got another chance to ruin their spells, and headed for the Library of Thoth.  There they introduced Anaximander to the animated bust of Stemelis, and let the two ancient guys keep each other company while they explored more.

Vael found a secret door north of the kitchen, which led to a dusty narrow corridor.  In the corridor was a skeleton with a chef's hat and a cleaver, who was angry at the intrusion.  He was only one skeleton though, and Vallium and Lacrymosa finished him off pretty quickly.  The skeleton had a scroll in its hand that turned out to be a recipe for baboon stew, which they took.  Continuing east, they found another secret door at the other end of the passage which led to an area north of the baboon cave.  They saw Yamki, the giant 4-armed baboon they had wounded before, leaning on a stick, standing in the entrance to the cave watching them.  Neither side made any threatening moves, and the group moved away from the baboons.

They went north to a room with a baboon statue and a door they had not tried before.  The door had a picture of an ear on it, so everyone listened to it, but heard nothing.  It was locked, and Vallium pulled out his collection of keys.  The first one he tried fit, and he unlocked the door, but a needle trap was triggered.  He pulled his hand out of the way in time to avoid being pricked, if there was ever any chance of the needle penetrating his armored gauntlets.  After some brief discussion of whether they could try to recover poison from the needle, they decided the risk to reward ratio was poor, and Vallium carefully broke off the needle and threw it into a corner.

The room to the north was large, with columns, a dais in the center, and an opening to the Great Chasm to the east.  Vallium checked out the chasm, while Ioannes and Vael looked at the dais.  There was an ivory oliphant, and a Mithric note that said to "Name Thyself and Whisper They Message and Thou Shalt Be Rewarded in Thine Ear."  Vael complied, but the message he received was some stupid song about 99 flagons of ale on the wall.  Ioannes also tried, and heard a very deep voice saying "Me hide pretty rock in water.  Nobody find it now!"

Looking over the chasm, Vael thought he saw something to the southeast.  He Levitated over the chasm to inspect a creepy magical soapstone idol of some kind of salamander, with empty eye sockets and a gaping mouth.  He came back and cast Flight on Vallium so that Vallium could carry the others over the chasm.  They avoided the statue and explored a cave filled about 3 feet deep in bones.  After not finding anything in the bones for a few minutes, Vael searched for secret doors, and found a concealed exit to the east.   He then cast Seek Magic, then Seek Earth twice, for gold and platinum.  When these spells revealed nothing in this room and platinum off to the east, he suggested they stop searching and go east.

It led to a large round cavern, with a shaft in the middle, in which there was a huge creepy triangular obelisk, clearly crafted not natural.  The obelisk continued up about 20' above their heads, and down farther than their Continual Light went.  Vael Levitated up to the top of the obelisk and saw a pentagram on top, with a metal coffer within the pentagram.  He avoided touching the pentagram and tried Apportating the coffer open, but it appeared to be welded shut.  He looked at the pentagram to see if it looked like platinum, but it looked more like silver to him.  

Vael flew back down, informed the others, then flew down the obelisk about 90' without seeing the bottom.  Not wanting to stray too far, he flew back up, cast Trace on his Returning Pebble, and dropped it.  It fell about 150' before stopping.  Vael then flew down to the bottom and found the obelisk sat in a natural cave, with nothing very interesting within range of his light.  Not wanting to explore solo, he returned to the others.

Leaving the obelisk, they went north down a narrow tunnel until they found two bodies, one wearing slightly glowing orange mail, in front of a stone chest.  As they inspected the bodies, a flaming skull flew out of the wall to attack Vallium.  He parried, and a quick combat ensued, where Vallium kept stabbing it (while not doing much damage, as his sword mostly passed through the flames) and Lacrymosa tried both arrows and her cloak.  Eventually Vallium scored three critical hits in a row and the skull was dispelled.  They searched the bodies and found a small magic silver eye, a few coins, a scroll, and a couple of potions.

Iaonnes went to open the chest but Vael yelled him away and tried using Apportation instead.  That failed because the chest was locked.  Vael thought he noticed some writing on the chest and cautioned the others against reading it.  Eventually he opened the chest with a Lockmaster spell followed by an Apportation, without setting off any traps.  Inside the chest were a bunch of silver coins, a few of the extremely valuable huge ancient octagonal platinum coins, a magic silver torc, another copy of the Litany of Light (this one much shorter and less fancy than the one from the library), a magic pick, and a few potions.

With their desire for treasure temporarily met, they went back to the Well of Light to try replacing the mirror and saying the Litany of Light.  Vael cast Flight on Vallium again so he could ferry the others across the chasm, and then everyone went back to the library.  Stamelis looked ready to have Anaximander taken off his hands, then was disappointed when Vallium just grabbed the huge mirror from behind the stacks and went right back out the door.  Vallium maneuvered the mirror onto the tripod while Vael and Ioannes gave helpful hints.  Eventually they placed it correctly and light went out in all directions, then Vael went to play with some of the secondary mirrors and bounce the light around.

With the mirror in place, Ioannes conducted the Litany of Light.  He went to the four small rooms surrounding the Well of Light, and in each room said the correct Mithric words.  His poor Mithric pronunciation was just good enough to trigger each effect, and he ended up with Infravision, an intelligence bonus, See Secrets, and Invisibility.  Vael and Vallium followed him around and repeated the rituals, and each of them got the same bonuses.  Lacrymosa did not participate.  With See Secrets in effect, everyone started running around looking for secret doors.  They found one northeast of the Ruby Chair, and another one northwest.

They opened the secret door northeast of the Ruby Chair (with the hidden catch on the floor made obvious by Thoth's blessing) and went east into a room, with an apparently accurate magically animated star field on the ceiling (despite it being daytime outside), and a couple of mosaics, one depicting the room with the Ruby Chair, another depicting some unknown large room with a bunch of statues.  They continued east to find a room with a couple of corpses, which Ioannes thought had been killed by some kind of strong impaling damage.  Both were wearing red ceremonial robes and hats.  One had a belt pouch, which they took without opening.  Another was lying on a big bronze key.  One was wearing magic boots.  They took all the loot but left the old rotted robes and hats.

Continuing east, they found a room containing two ibis statues.  The statues unfortunately did not seem to like visitors, and animated and attacked Lacrymosa, the only visible intruder.  Looking at their beaks, Ioannes now had a pretty good idea how the corpses to the west had been impaled.  Invisible Vallium had a free shot at the back of one of the constructs, and hit it squarely, but not hard enough to take it down.  Lacrymosa ran away while rapidly firing arrows, which the other construct dodged with amazing speed.  Ioannes and Vael tried to stay out of the way and stay Invisible.  After a few more tries, Lacrymosa finally managed to nail one of the constructs in the leg, slowing it and knocking it down.  It didn't dodge so well after that, and stopped moving after a few more arrows hit it.  Meanwhile Vallium landed a second, harder hit on the other ibis to slow it, then finished it off.  With See Secrets still running, everyone noticed a secret door on the south wall behind where one of the constructs had been standing, but nobody opened it.

In a hurry to go home, the party took a quick look to the east and saw a dead-end room with some spiral stairs down.  They then doubled back, closing the secret door behind them.  They went back to the Library, retrieved Anaximander, then went back to Gosterwick.  Vallium took Anaximander to the Temple of Mitra to see if they could help him, while Vael and Ioannes went back to the Arcane Practitioners Club to start identifying their loot.



GM's Comments:


That was an exceptionally productive delve.  All the previous visits to the Well of Light level had been interrupted by periodic baboon attacks, but with the baboons apparently herded into the Howling Caves to the southeast, there were fewer interruptions this time, which made exploration easier.

Using a Trace spell on the Returning Pebble was a creative way to figure out what the 3 dark mouths did, without actually risking crawling in.  Vael used a lot of caution this session, not touching the salamander statue or the pentagram on top of the obelisk, and trying to open every container with Apportation rather than his hands, but still got poisoned by the magic pool.

Anaximander seemed too crazy to give the party useful information, but Ioannes still dared climbing into the marble chair that they pulled Anaximander out of, and got an answer about the Litany of Light.

Replacing the mirror and performing the Litany of Light correctly got four useful magical effects with long (but not permanent) durations.  See Secrets revealed three secret doors, two in areas the group had walked past before without searching.  And Invisibility gave Vallium a free rear attack on the ibis construct, which contributed to quickly winning that battle.


Achievements:
The Rescuers: 1 XP for pulling Anaximander out of the Oracle of Thoth and bringing him back to town
The Litany of Light: 1 XP for restoring the mirror and performing the full Litany

XP:
Exploration: About 17 new locations, 1 XP
Loot: A few magic items plus 5 of those valuable huge ancient platinum coins, 2 XP
Achievements: 2 XP
Total: 5 XP

Next week:

They left a couple of secret doors and a staircase unexplored at the end of the session, so they'll probably be back.  Though there was some talk of trying to rescue Lillian, the canon of the Temple of Mitra in Newmarket, now that Vael has some knowledge magic that might make it easier to find her.  (Of course there was also talk of killing Plumthorn's halflings, but pretty much only from Lacrymosa, who always wants to kill the halflings.)

DFRPG Arden Vul Session 23a: Gelatinous Cube and Slime Kraken
Date: 
Basilsday, 16th of Gerakios, 2993 AE 


Weather: 

Hot, dry


Player Characters: 

Vael Sunshadow, Half-Elven mage (Kyle)
Vallium Halcyon, Archontean fighter (Greybrown)
Ioannes Grammatikos Byzantios, Archontean cleric of Demma (Demented Avenger)
Michael J. Dundee, Thorcin barbarian (Adam)
Uvash Edzuson, Dwarven cleric of Zodarrim (Cosmo)


Significant NPCs:

Lillian, captured Canon of Mitra
Kronos, Innkeeper at the Sign of the Broken Head
4 Ghouls
Gelatinous Cube
Slime Kraken
Susarra, Archontean fighter
Several Set guards


Vallium formulated a plan to rescue Lillian.  They would avoid the halflings, bribe the beastmen (who rumor claimed had taken Lillian) with food for information on Lillian or for her release, bring her back to the Church of Mitra, and profit.

The first part of the plan went pretty well.  They loaded up their mule with food and took it up to the ruins of Arden Vul.  Not wanting to take the mule into the Halls, they instead took it to the Sign of the Broken Head and paid Kronos for boarding.  They then loaded the food into a wheelbarrow, went down through the basement entrance to avoid the halflings, and headed south toward the beastmen.

On the way, they searched for secret doors in the Thothian burial niches, and found one.  Opening it up found a crypt containing some elaborate sarcophagi and 4 angry ghouls.  The ghouls surprised Michael, but failed to hurt him.  A quick battle ensued, with Michael and Vallium smacking down the ghouls.  The grave goods included a couple of magical white gold rings, a high quality spear, and some silver torcs and alabaster urns.  The party took the light loot and left the heavy stuff in the secret tomb to grab on the way out.

As they approached beastman territory, Vael cast Seeker looking for Lillian.  The spell showed her bound, gagged, and injured, in a prison cell.  It said the cell was somewhere to the northwest, away from the beastmen.  Vael followed up the Seeker with a Trace so he could keep homing in on Lillian.  At that point they decided to turn around and not talk to the beastmen after all, since it appeared they didn't have Lillian.

They went north and west until they reached the room with 3 portcullises and 3 levers.  Vael, who hadn't been there before, wanted to go up the stairs to the south, but Vallium explained that it led to parts of the Well of Light lever that they had not fully explored, and pulled him back on target.  Vael, not wanting to touch anything he didn't have to, used Apportation to move the middle lever and open the middle portcullis.  They then headed west into a maze of catacombs, filled with burial niches whose plugs had been removed.  Knowing it would take forever to search all the niches, everyone kept their eyes open for obvious doors or treasure, but nobody took time to search.

At one point Uvash was in the lead and almost ran right into a nearly invisible form ahead.  He saw some coins just hanging in the air, and stopped before becoming enveloped.  It was a large gelatinous cube.  Uvash backed away and called for help, as the others ran up.  The cube was huge but fairly slow.  Uvash was a bit worried that it might damage his fancy mace, but took a swing at it anyway, and did a bit of damage.  Michael and Vallium ran up and started rapidly hacking at it.  It kept trying to hit them with slimy pseudopods, but didn't aim very well.  Eventually they hit it enough that it slowed down further and stopped dodging effectively, and then they just kept hitting it until it stopped twitching.

There were some coins and gems inside the cube's body, along with a wand.  Michael, wearing heavy armor and a Ring of Free Action, was able to crawl in and grab the gems and wand without getting hurt, but his armor was smoking a bit.  Manually getting all the coins didn't seem worth the risk, but since coins are pretty sturdy, Vael used Create Fire to just melt the remains of the cube to ash, and they picked the coins out of the remains.

They found a door heading south, but it had no obvious handle, did not budge when they tried pushing it open, and appeared too strong to break down without mining tools.  Vael tried using Apportation to push the door in every direction, but his spell failed to move the door.  Giving up, the group resumed walking around the catacombs looking for secret doors.  Ioannes found one to the northwest, but it led to stairs down, and Vael was pretty sure Lillian was on this level, so they didn't go that way.

Giving up on finding another door, they went back to the heavy door, and Vael used Shape Earth to dig a small tunnel through the rock a few yards away from the door.  His first couple of tries didn't go far enough, but eventually he managed to dig a small tunnel through to another room.  Vallium volunteered to crawl through it first, and didn't find anything dangerous in the room, just the bodies of a couple of humans and a couple of ghouls.  Everyone else crawled in, and they looted a shortsword and a ring.  There was a door on the north wall, which led to a short passage and then the door they had been unable to open from the other side.  From this side, it was possible to push it open with enough effort.  However, it closed itself shortly after they stopped pushing on it, and nobody had any spikes to keep it open.

Heading east, they found another room with doors south and east.  The southern door was spiked shut.  Vael confirmed that Lillian was still southwest, so they pulled the spikes and went south.  They saw doors south and west.  The western room was small and completely trashed.

To the south, however, was a very large room, containing a circular pool with a statue of Thoth inside it.  The temple had been thoroughly and deliberately trashed, and both clerics felt like it was a place of negative sanctity.  There was some anti-Thoth graffiti on the walls, and a picture of a crocodile eating an ibis, indicating that the vandalism was probably the work of Settites.  Worse, when Vallium went into the room, a lot of tentacles emerged from the pool to grab him.  Everyone retreated back north out of the room, with Vallium chopping off a couple of the tentacles as he parried their attacks.

After some discussion, the group decided they needed to get past the tentacle beast, but since they now knew it was there, they could buff themselves first.  Vael would cast Great Haste on the fighters, while Ioannes cast Flaming Weapon.  Vael flubbed his first couple of attempts to Great Haste Michael, but the third try worked, and then Michael opened the door and charged south.  He ran right into the pool, not slowed because of his Ring of Free Action, and started cutting off tentacles as the slime kraken tried dragging him under.  At one point it looked like Michael critically failed an attack and crippled his own shield arm, but his Bless spell sacrificed itself and prevented the self-inflicted attack.  A few seconds later, Vallium also came charging into the room at double speed, and now the slime beast was surrounded.  Both Vallium and Michael kept cutting off tentacles, then went after its body.  With all its tentacles gone, the beast started biting with its beak.  Uvash used Divine Grace then followed them into the room, but Michael finished the slime creature off with multiple rapid strikes from behind before Uvash arrived.

With the battle over, Vael was very tired after casting multiple Great Hastes, and Vallium and Michael were tired from fighting.  While they rested, Ioannes started searching and found a magical sheet of yellow glass in the pool.  Rather than reaching into the murky water, he Apportated it out.  After resting, everyone started circling the room and looking for secret doors.  Vael found a secret door in the north wall, with a small empty alcove behind it.  Later he searched in the same spot on the south wall and found a matching secret door and empty alcove.  There were doors in all four corners of the rooms.  Both of the ones on the east side led to ramps up to galleries overlooking the temple.  One of the ramps had a bit of adventuring equipment left on it, and Vallium grabbed some spikes.

The most promising door, in the southwest corner, led to a small passage south, another door, and a cave-in.  The cave in was large enough that Vael did not feel he could use Shape Earth to get past it.  Everyone returned to the temple and searched again for secret doors.  They did not find any, but Uvash spotted an iron key in the fountain, which Vael Apportated out, dried off, and added to their keyring.

Giving up on manually searching, Vael pulled out the Wand of See Secrets and used a charge.  At that point a secret door to the southwest and a peephole high on the west wall became obvious to him.  He ran around the temple while the spell lasted, finding another secret door off the southeast gallery.  He then doubled back north through the other rooms they had searched.  He did not find any more secret doors there.  There was one door to the east which they had not opened, and, caution thrown aside while racing the spell duration, Vael opened it rather than waiting for Vallium and Michael to catch up.  There was an armed and armored woman hiding in the room.  Fortunately for Vael, she did not attack, and instead asked who he was and what he was doing there.  Vael didn't want to talk, as he was trying to find secret doors, but he explained that they were looking for Lillian.  The woman didn't know who Lillian was, but said that her name was Susarra and her friends had been killed by ghouls and she was looking for a way out past the tentacle monster.  When Vael indicated that they had killed the monster and invited her to tag along, she followed him out of the room.

They listened to the southwestern secret door, opened it, and found a room full of trash.  There were some footprints leading from the secret door to the middle of the room, then vanishing.  Everyone started searching for more secret doors.  While searching, Vallium triggered a spear trap.  It barely penetrated his helmet, scratching his face.  Vallium broke the spear in half to make sure that didn't happen again.  They eventually found a concealed door on the south wall.

When they opened the door, a trap went off, and gas started pouring into the room with a loud hiss.  Everyone managed to hold their breath before breathing any of the gas, and then Vael cast a Purify Air to clear the room.  The group went south through the door, and saw some Set guards in their distinctive red scale armor, looking angry.  There wasn't enough time left in the session to fight the battle, so the session ended there.


GM's Comments:

Slime Kraken might be my new favorite monster name.

Gelatinous Cubes are fun, but they're also slow and stupid, so unless they surprise you and get a free attack, or corner you, they're not as dangerous as they seem.

You would think that the combination of Seeker and Trace and Shape Earth would make reaching a prisoner within one four-hour session pretty easy.  Find the prisoner, head toward the prisoner, and if you can't find a way toward the prisoner, dig one.  But four hours flew by this week, despite only finishing three fights.


Achievements:

None

XP:

None until they get back to down, but they explored some new territory and found a bit of loot.


Next Week:

We know they'll be starting the session fighting those Set guards, and then, if they win, presumably resuming the search for Lillian.

Continuing from the previous session, Vallium came through the gas-trapped doorway, with Vael, Ioannes, and Susarra close behind him.  Uvash and Michael were well behind.  There was one Set guard in red scale armor peering around a corner ahead, shouting back reports to his allies.  Vallium charged, while yelling for nobody to stand right behind him.  The guard waited until Vallium was two yards away to fire his crossbow -- and somehow missed.  Whether this was due to Vallium's Amulet of Missile Shield, or the guard just panicking, was hard to tell.

The guard backed around the corner.  There was a short staircase up, with a 4' tall barricade at the top, and several more guards behind the barricade, holding crossbows.  A couple more took shots at Vallium as he and the first guard ran up the stairs, then dropped their crossbows and pulled out maces or potions.  Meanwhile Michael and Uvash caught up to Vael, who cast Great Haste on Michael.

Vallium neared the barricade as a couple of the guards threw down Alchemist's Fire potions, but missed him.  By then Michael was double-timing up the stairs behind him, and Vael was near the bottom of the steps casting a Grease spell.  The Set deacon at the top of the stairs concentrated on a spell for a couple of seconds, so Vallium let go of his sword (letting it hang from a lanyard), reached into his potion belt, and smashed a Magebane potion.  This emitted a sickly smoke that kept everyone within a few yards of Vallium from casting wizard spells for a while -- but the caster was a cleric and was not affected.  He finished his Dispel Magic spell, catching Vallium and Michael and Susarra in it.  He was trying to dismiss Vallium's Missile Shield (which failed because it was a permanent magic item, not a spell) and Michael's Great Haste.  The attempt was successful, and also dismissed a couple of Continual Light rocks as well as Vallium's Bless.

It didn't get the Grease though, which was cast behind the barricade outside the area of effect of the Dispel, and the guards started slipping and sliding.  Michael stabbed the one on the stairs.  Vallium recovered his sword and hit a couple behind the barricade.  Susarra got to the barricade and got a couple of axe swings in.  As the battle turned against his side, the deacon commanded one of the unwounded guards to run north and set reinforcements.  A badly wounded guard broke ranks and followed him.  After taking a hit, the deacon retreated west.  Uvash reached the top and opened the gate in the barricade, and the party poured through.  They eventually took down all but one of the guards, but the one survivor ran north into an area with a red tiled floor, pulled open a black curtain, and ran into the large room beyond while yelling for help.

Vallium used his Ring of Illusion Disguise to look like the cleric they had just defeated, whose guards had called Deacon Hurub.  He followed the guard into the big temple room to the north while yelling "The Azure Knights are attacking, there are too many, retreat."  A couple of set clerics were leading many cultists in a service nearby.  Many of the cultists broke and ran in various directions.  Vallium waited at the curtain for a few seconds, while Vael cast Great Haste on both Vallium and Michael, and Ioannes followed up with Flaming Weapon.  Once they were fully buffed, everyone ran into the temple.  Michael chased the retreating guard to the west, trailed by Vael, and eventually caught and killed him, but by then about eight more guards were streaming out of two rooms north and south.  Uvash and Ioannes and Susarra went east toward a huge statue of Set in Set animal form, and killed a few cultists.  Vallium chased some clerics to the northeast into a room with a portcullis, and killed them both before they got it open.  There was a brief difference of opinion about who was the real cleric of Set and who was the traitor or imposter, but Vallium won the argument using his sword, and the nearby cultists helped him finish off the acolyte.

Michael was beset by a lot of guards, but he had Great Haste, and Vael cast two Grease spells and a Smoke spell among the guards to help him.  Michael eventually downed all of them.  Meanwhile Susarra ran between two long rectangular pools to come help Michael, when a huge crocodile unexpectedly emerged from one of the pools and tried to eat her.  She avoided being surprised and eventually killed it with a couple of solid axe blows.  A second crocodile came out later, and she wounded it badly enough that it went back under the water to hide and wait for easier prey.

Uvash and Ioannes, after running out of nearby cultists, decided to try to desecrate the evil temple.  Ioannes first tried to knock over the huge statue, but it was just too heavy.  They then decided to take its ruby eyes.  The statue was 25' tall, so its eyes were well out of reach.  Uvash climbed up the statue with his Ring of Climbing, then dropped a rope to help Ioannes up, since Ioannes had the Apportation spell and could take the rubies without actually touching them.  This plan worked, and Ioannes magically grabbed two huge rubies and dropped them in Uvash's pouch, before climbing back down.  Ioannes then stole everything he could find on the Settites' evil sacrificial altar.  He and Uvash then knocked it over.

Vallium chased down and killed two more deacons who were trying to escape down a wide staircase to the west, then dragged them back into the temple and took their portable valuables.  He and Vael shut the huge bronze doors, and Vael Magelocked them.  Vael ran around the room looking for magic items, and Susarra explored the temple looking for other valuables.  Everyone then retreated to the room to the south, outside the temple's Set-aligned sanctity, to rest and heal.  Both Michael and Susarra were fairly wounded, so Ioannes used Stop Bleeding and Major Healing to patch them up.

After the long battle, and with the Set Cult fully alerted to their presence, it was time to decide whether to head back to Gosterwick or press on looking for Lillian.  The group unanimously decided to keep looking for Lillian rather than retreating, so they ended the session, very close to where they started it, but surrounded by a lot of dead Settites (and one dead crocodile).


GM's Comments:

This was by far the biggest battle we've fought in this campaign, 5 PCs and an NPC against over 20 Settites and a couple of crocodiles.  It took almost the whole session.  I should have taken some screenshots.



Achievements:

None


XP:

None until they get back to town, but they explored even more new territory and found some more loot.


Next Week:

They're pretty sure they're close to Lillian now, so they're going to try to rescue her and get out before whatever portion of the Set cult is left gets their revenge.

We resumed in the dungeon, after the party killed or chased off everyone in the Temple of Set and spent a few minutes looting.  The group retreated south out of the temple, back into the guard room atop the barricade, where until the sanctity level (for non-Settites) went back to normal, then rested.  They then searched the western wall, where the Set deacon had been running, and found a door concealed behind a screen.  They went west through a torture chamber, then through a black curtain into some kind of waiting room with pews, then south into a robing room.  There were some red Settite robes there, but not enough for everyone, and Uvash refused to wear them anyway.  With some of the group disguised and some not, they searched for secret doors and found one on the south wall, leading to a narrow spy corridor. Heading west, they found some peepholes into a prison, with seven cells, six prisoners (including Lillian), and four guards.  Without a way into the prison from here, they doubled back north, east, and then south down some stairs.

Suddenly some candles lining the stairs start smoking, and loud screams came from somewhere.  Magically alerted, several guards poured out of a room to the southeast.  A six-on-six battle commenced.  Susarra, Vallium, and Michael filled the corridor to the south, with Uvash, Vael, and Ioannes behind them.  On the other side were 4 Set guards, a Set torturer with a long whip, and a Set wizard who was throwing Force Missiles at Michael from the doorway.




The Set ranks held for a few seconds, while Vael cast Great Haste on Michael.  Then once Michael started attacking twice as fast, he downed an enemy and charged forward to get the wizard, while Uvash moved up to fill the hole on the left.  Vallium and Susarra kept holding the line and stabbing Settites, and Ioannes cast several Stop Bleeding and Major Healing spells to keep his allies up.  As the Settites started to fall, they yelled for help, and reinforcements started coming from the west.  It was the four guards the party had seen before, plus a jailer they had not spotted.




As the original Settites to the east fell, the battle moved west toward the approaching reinforcements.  Vael dropped a Grease spell in the hallway, which resulted in several Settites missing attack or defense rolls or falling over.  Michael, with his Ring of Free Action, was unaffected by the bad footing, and mercilessly hacked through the Settites before his Great Haste could run out.  Susarra and Uvash and Vallium followed behind him, staying out of the Grease but helping finish the Settites.  Eventually, all 11 of the Settites went down.

Vael and Michael were exhausted after the battle, so took a few minutes to rest, with Ioannes casting Lend Energy.  Once everyone could stand up, they took a preliminary pass over the bodies looking for magical loot, then they went west.  They heard a woman yelling from behind an open door to the north.  In the room was the jailer's prisoner Eadgithu, manacled to the wall.  Vallium grabbed the jailer's key ring and tried keys until one freed her, at which point Eadgithu thanked them and went to grab a sword off the jailer's body.  Vael saw a lockbox in the room and cautiously opened it using the keys and an Apportation spell, finding some coins and gems and a spellbook.  The group then went west to the prison.

There were 6 prisoners visible.  Three of them (Lillian, an overweight man, and a tough-looking man) were manacled to the back of their cells and gagged.  The other three (a goblin, a fishman, and a well-muscled dwarf) were not tied or gagged.  Half of the prisoners showed obvious wounds, while the others appeared to be in better shape.  Vallium used the jailer's keys to free Lillian first, and Ioannes healed her wounds.  She then explained who some of the other prisoners were.  She said the tough-looking man was Azgallatu, a warrior cleric of Mitra who had been captured trying to find her, and he should definitely be freed.  She stated that the goblin (who showed no wounds) was some high-ranking noble captive, at which point Gribble interrupted to introduce himself and said he was the brother of King Wiskenim, who would certainly reward his rescuers.  Lillian and Gribble agreed that the fishman was unfriendly and also didn't seem to speak any languages they knew, so he was left in his cell.  The overweight man was Geleg, a wizard, who when ungagged immediately thanked his rescuers then asked if anyone had seen his spellbook.  Vael admitted to having found a spellbook but asked if he could copy any spells, and Geleg immediately agreed to let Vael copy anything he wanted.  The dwarf seemed a bit unfriendly, so Vallium passed the keys to Uvash to deal with him.  Grist asked Uvash several questions, apparently suspicious that he might be a doppleganger, before agreeing that he was an actual dwarf and warming up slightly.  He was badly wounded, so he appreciated the healing spell Ioannes gave him.  Azgallatu, when freed, thanked the party then immediately took up position at Lillian's side.

With a horde of rescued prisoners in tow, the party went back east to loot the room at the bottom of the stairs.  There were several heads mounted on the walls, of a lion, some kind of reptile man, a member of Gog's species, and a goblin.  The goblin head appeared to be magical.  Gribble wanted to throw it in a nearby disposal hole, but because it was magical Vael argued that it couldn't be left where the Settites could recover it, so Gribble reluctantly put it in a chest (where he didn't have to look at it) and carried it out.  Meanwhile each of the other prisoners was asked to carry a suit of red Set scale armor.  So burdened, the group went back north up the stairs, east over the barricade, north through the gas-trapped room (the trap had not reset), and back into the desecrated temple of Thoth were the slime kraken had been killed.

There was some debate on whether to go north or east.  Vallium argued that east was closer to the halflings so north was safer.  Ioannes countered that with so many of them, the halflings would probably be too scared to fight.  But the decision was made to go north and try to avoid contact.  Vael re-cast Shape Earth to cover the ends of the passage he had made next to the one-way door, and everyone went north through the one-way door then east through the catacombs to the portcullis.  They closed the portcullis behind them, then went south through the burial niches to the secret room where they had stashed a wheelbarrow full of food.

Vael and Vallium wanted to give the food to someone rather than waste it, so they asked Lillian the story of her capture.  She said she had been looking for Settite activity when she had been grabbed by the Green Fang Kobolds, who traded her to the beastmen, who traded her to the Settites, who threw her in their jail and tortured her.  This dropped everyone's opinion of the beastmen, and they decided to give the food to Gog instead of the beastmen.  They instructed everyone to leave the heavy scale armor in the secret door, grabbed the wheelbarrow of food, and headed south and east to the concealed door behind the baboon fresco.  They took the hidden stairs down to the Cave of Gog.

Gog heard them coming, and was waiting outside the secret door when it opened.  He was pleased to see the wheelbarrow of food and asked if it was for him.  Pleased to hear that he was, he got his boat and had them dump all the food from the wheelbarrow into it.  Gribble said that goblin territory was just to the south and asked if the party would like to meet his brother the king.  The other freed prisoners were not so enthusiastic about tromping through goblin territory, but they didn't want to go back to Gosterwick without their heavily armed escort either, so they came along.  Gribble led them south into a room full of many goblins, who enthusiastically greeted him.  Their leader led Gribble and his huge entourage east to Killik, the Boss of the Wet Caves.  Killik then appointed one of the other goblin captains Temporary Boss and went with Gribble down a long staircase to Goblintown.

Arriving in Goblintown, Killik and Gribble led the party through a confusing maze of passages.  At one point they were led across a rickety bridge "maybe not so strong for big people go one at a time."  Uvash actually broke one slat of the bridge when crossing it, but managed not to fall.  They eventually reached a room with ogre guards outside, where the goblin major-domo, Pelestrim, greeted Gribble and went into the room to arrange an audience.  A minute later, Gribble and his rescuers were invited in to meet King Weskenim.

King Weskenim asked Gribble a lot of questions in Goblin, then thanked his rescuers in accented Archontean, and said he wasn't prepared for their arrival but promised them a reward next time they visited.  He also mentioned the need to recover the Scepter of the Goblins.  When Vael asked if the goblins knew about any other entrances to the Halls, Weskenim said that was a sore point, that Plumthorn's Halflings were squatting on his rightful entrance to the surface, and needed to be removed.  After hearing how many Settites they had killed, he said the Right for Riches company were just the halfling exterminators he needed and to please take care of the infestation at their earliest convenience.  He warned them that the halflings had a wizard and used poison.  At some point during the meeting, Weskenim's cat jumped onto his shoulder, at which point the king had to end the meeting to play with the cat.

With the royal audience concluded, Killik led the party and their freed prisoners back up to the Wet Caves, this time taking a longer route that didn't involve any bridges that might not be strong enough for armored humans or dwarves.  At one point he rushed them past some kind of demon imprisoned in a summoning circle reciting obscure mathematical formulae, but didn't answer any questions.  They went back up to the Wet Caves, then back to Gog's Cave, where Gog was happily sorting his newly acquired food.  Gog ferried everyone across the underground stream in his boat, and they went upstairs, then out to the surface through the basement exit, then back to the Broken Head to get their mule, then back to the dam to stow their wheelbarrow, then finally back to Gosterwick.

In Gosterwick, Jador the Just at the Temple of Mitra was excited to see Lillian had been rescued, and detailed a lesser cleric to go with Ioannes to the Silent Factor and transfer the reward money to his account.  Anaximander, the ancient sage they had rescued previously, had been healed of his insanity, and was dictating the events of 250 years ago to some other clerics.  Vael asked for access to Anaximander, and Jador agreed to let him read the notes the clerics had compiled so far, and also personally visit him.  Lillian and Azgallatu said they would stay at the the Temple of Mitra for a few days before heading to Newmarket, while the other freed prisoners got rooms or bunkroom beds elsewhere in Gosterwick.


GM's Comments:

Another large battle, but not as large as last week.  Great Haste is still very good.  Grease is pretty good too.

I need to spend more time with the Foundry Token Attacher module so I can quickly make a train of NPCs follow a PC.

I was not really prepared for the PCs to go down to Goblintown (I should have been, since they were heading for Lillian and Gribble was in the next cell over, but I had wrongly assumed they would just let Gribble go rather than following him home) so had to scramble to find the right paths for everyone to take around the Goblintown map.  Since there wasn't a lot of time left in the session, I rushed through the first meeting with King Weskenim and had him invite them back for another one.


Achievements:

The Rescuers: for rescuing Susarra, Lillian, Gribble, Eadgithu, Geleg, and Grist.
Quest: for bringing Lillian back to the Temple of Mitra
Knockback: 1 XP to Uvash for the first hit with a blunt weapon hard enough to achieve knockback.  (This happened all the time in GURPS 3E, but is rarer in 4E and DFRPG due to some rules changes.)
XP:
Exploration: about 47 rooms (across 3 sessions) (many of them led through goblin territory), 2 XP
Loot: reward money, 2 giant rubies, coins and gems and weapons and armor: 2 XP
Achievements: 2 group achievements, 1 individual achievement for Uvash
Total: 7 XP for Uvash, 6 XP for Vael/Vallium/Ioannes, 4 XP for Michael (missed a session)

Next Week:

The PCs have a lot of options.  The obvious ones are to try to get their reward from King Weskenim, further battle the Cult of Set, or finally deal with Plumthorn's Halflings.  But they also have several parts of the Halls to explore.

DFRPG Bonus Downtime Recap: Strange Happenings in Gosterwick
There's this idea in DFRPG that Town is a "safe zone".  PCs can shop and train there and don't have to worry about being robbed or murdered.

Is that true in Gosterwick, 10 miles south of the ruins of Arden Vul?  Apparently not.

The Right for Riches company returned to Gosterwick after their successful mission to rescue Canon Lillian of the Church of Mitra from the dungeons of the Cult of Set. This mission incidentally resulted in the deaths of about a dozen Settites guarding the path to Lillian's cell, plus about a dozen more Settites in the nearby Temple of Set who just happened to be doing the wrong evil ritutal in the wrong place at the wrong time.  And a giant crocodile who took advantage of the chaos to try to eat an allied NPC.  While the PCs were in the Temple of Set, they also stole anything valuable looking that wasn't too heavy, including a couple of gigantic and incredibly valuable rubies from the largest cult statue's eyes.  And some of the PCs may or may not have urinated on a holy altar of Set; the stories are inconsistent.





(Artistic interpretation of Uvash and Ioannes stealing the ruby eyes of the cult statue in the Temple of Set, over the corpse of the giant crocodile Susarra killed, while Vael, Michael, Vallium, and an unidentified NPC discuss their next move.)
It appears that the Cult of Set was not happy about any of this.  A few days after the Right for Riches Company returned to Gosterwick, two things happened:

Coinbase, leader of the Grudge Brigade Mercenary Company, received an anonymous offer under his door.  It promised a payment of $2500 each for Vael, Vallium, Ioannes, Uvash, Michael, or Susarra, dead or alive.  They or their remains should be brought to the Duty Deacon in the Forum of Set, who would then contact the Pontifex to verify the identify of the invader and pay the reward.  (Coinbase decided to sell the contract to Vael rather than acting on it.)
Susarra was decapitated in her bed at the Yellow Cloak Inn.  Her head and the more valuable and portable parts of her gear were missing.  Vallium, who the innkeeper had seen with Susarra, was called in to identify the body, and then Vael showed up and asked for a blood sample from the victim.  His request was initially denied by the guards at the crime scene, while one of them added Vael's name to A List.  Later that denial was overruled by Audun Yellow-Eyes, head of the Drome in Gosterwick, who sent a blood sample to Vael.
Once he got the blood sample, Vael cast Seeker followed by Trace, revealing that Susarra's head was currently in a backpack tossed in a corner of a comfortable room, about ten miles north of Gosterwick.  Vael could maintain the Trace spell as long as he could stay awake, but could not cast Seeker again for a week, so he advocated cutting short the usual week of downtime between delves and immediately going after whoever murdered Susarra.

After the murder of Susarra, the Right for Riches company decided to head back to Arden Vul before the Trace spell on her head wore off.  Knowing that he couldn't sleep without losing the Trace, Vael first went to the Temple of Mitra to see if any of the priests there could cast Vigil to let him go a night without sleep without ill effects.  Unfortunately, nobody there was able to cast Vigil.

The party then went to the House of Sight in Gosterwick where they were granted a meeting with the logothete, Audun Yellow-Eyes.  Audun explained that he was appalled by the murder of Susarra, but could not officially endorse an attack on Set, or lend any resources to one.  Also that if anyone asked about the vial of Susarra's blood sent to Vael, it wasn't him.

They continued to the Azure Keep to try to arrange a meeting with Lady Alexia.  Unfortunately, she was not available.  They did meet with her steward, Freydis the Stern, who gave her condolences on Susarra and said that she would pass along any inquiries to Lady Alexia when she returned.

With no help forthcoming, they headed out for Arden Vul just after sunset.  A few miles from the Cliff Face, they heard riders coming south down the Imperial Road toward their lights.  It was four Knights of the Azure Shield, who asked them to identify themselves, they had questions about Michael's red scale armor.  They were satisfied with the answer that the armor had come off a dead Settite and there hadn't been time to repaint it before the Settites killed their friend and required a late night attack.  The knights continued their patrol.

When they reached the Cliff Face, they saw lights halfway up the cliff, west of the waterfall, at the site of the Set cult's basket.  Vael Levitated up to try improve his triangulation on Susarra's head.  He was surprised to see that she was at the same elevation as the Set basket, and somewhere west, rather than up at the level of the ruins.  Vael flew back down to confer with the group.  They decided to go up to the ruins of Arden Vul, then back down though the basement, around the halflings, and through the desecrated Temple of Thoth to reach the Temple of Set.

Everyone (except Vael, who was still Levitating) tied themselves together for the night climb.  About halfway up the Long Stair, they encountered a beastman patrol heading down.  The beastmen formed up into a hedgehog formation as their sergeant asked the group to identify themselves.  He then indicated that his group would back up to a wider spot on the trail and allow the party distance to pass, as they were not looking for conflict.  This was agreed, and the Right for Riches company passed by the beastmen as they stood in defensive formation.  They continued to the top of the climb, then north across the ruins.

They group passed through the basement without encountering anything, then went down the spiral stair, west through the illusory wall, south through the destroyed remains of a one-way door.  They discussed going through the catacombs to stay farther from the halflings, but decided the secret door behind the Thoth statue was faster.  They were lucky enough not to meet any halflings, and went down the narrow secret passage west into the desecrated Temple of Thoth.  At that point they heard the blaring of a horn from the secret peephole high on the west wall -- their bright lights had been spotted.

The party quickly went south through a secret door, carefully picked their way through a formerly trapped room, and set off the gas trap again, which had been reset.  Nobody breathed any of the gas, though, and they continued south to the corner, then looked up west to see the barricade had been rebuilt and there were a mass of guards in red Set scale armor behind it, commanded by a sergeant, and accompanied by a goat.

The guards threw Alchemist's Fire flasks at Michael, Vallium, and Ioannes.  Michael was directly hit and set on fire, but he was wearing the Serpent's Amulet and didn't mind.  While the others hung back a bit, Michael started up the stairs.  Meanwhile Vael cast Shape Fire and started moving the rest of the boiling oil up the stairs toward the barricade.  Vallium went up the stairs behind the fire, warning the others not to stand directly behind him.  Uvash trailed Vallium off to one side, and Vael and Ioannes stayed well back.

As Vallium made himself a conspicuous target, he took several shots from crossbows.  He dodged several, trying not to give away that he had an an Amulet of Missile Shield.  Up against the barricade, Michael took a point-blank crossbow shot and failed to dodge it, resulting in a major wound to the chest.  He responded by stabbing the arbalester with his long sword.  The Vael-controlled fire wrecked the Settite line, as half the guards jumped to the sides to avoid the fire, and a couple failed to dodge it, caught on fire, and had to stop, drop, and roll to put it out.

Michael went over the barricade and stabbed a couple more guards.  Vallium followed him over and joined in.  Uvash and Ioannes came up behind, and Ioannes reached over the barricade to heal Michael twice, first with Stop Bleeding and then with Major Healing.  Vael stayed on the stairs and just sent his fire around the room harassing the guards, who occasionally failed to dodge and had to stop fighting for a bit to roll around on the ground.

Meanwhile Sparky the Goat decided to help his sept by charging into battle to slam the invaders with his horns.  Unfortunately for Sparky, Vallium and Michael had shields and heavy armor, so his slams were not enough to knock them over.  Worse, Sparky was not wearing armor, so when he got hit by the fire, the room smelled of burning goat.  After a bit of fire damage and a stray sword or mace shot, Sparky went down and did not get back up.

The Set sergeant recognized that his side was losing, and told one of his unwounded guards to run north to the temple and get reinforcements.  Vael responded by sending some of his fire after that guard to try to slow him down.  Eventually, the Settites lost 6 elite guards and a goat, while 2 guards and the sergeant managed to flee north.

As Uvash ate some singed goat, Vael checked his Trace and found that Susarra's head was down and west.  The Right for Riches company quickly regrouped to discuss their next move.  Did they chase north through the temple, or cut west and try to reach the stairs?  Taking a quick look through the burned curtains, they saw some cultists  fleeing west and a giant lizard chasing a boar.  Deciding to avoid that chaos, they went back into the room to the south and grabbed a couple of flasks of Alchemist's Fire and a couple of maces that Vael thought looked nice, plus a few silver coins from a chest.  After leaving some rude graffiti and setting a few cots on fire, they went west through the passages between the temple and the prison, trying to outflank the guards in the temple and reach the stairs down.

Unfortunately for them, the Settites had thought of this, and there was a large group of guards waiting on the wide stairs.  It was a dozen guards, four acolytes, and a couple of sergeants, including the one they had just been fighting.  About half the guards had crossbows ready, and one of the sergeants was yelling "nobody use fire."


Start of the battle on the wide stairs




Vallium, with his Amulet of Missile Shield, led the way, trying to draw more crossbow fire.  Michael followed behind, drawing his boomerang.  He threw it into the clump of guards, missing one near the front.  Unfortunately for the guards, it was a target-rich environment, and the boomerang missed or was dodged by two more guards, before it plunked one in the back who had no idea was was happening.  He fell down, momentarily stunned, and dropped his mace.

Four of the six guards with crossbows fired at Vallium.  He dodged all of the shots (some legitimately, some with magical help), before critically failing one Dodge roll and starting to fall down.  Realizing that he didn't want to be prone next to a pile of enemies, he used Luck to reroll the critical failure and avoid the fall.  The last two crossbowmen held their fire, as the sergeant said something about waiting for a better target.  The guards in the back with maces and shields ready started surging to the front.

Uvash prayed for his Heroic Grace and got a great result, +7 to DX for 13 turns.  He decided to use this temporary blessing to go for aimed shots at the skull and try to knock guards unconscious with one blow.  Meanwhile Michael and Vallium just went toe-to-toe with the front row of guards and started cutting them down, Vallium with single Deceptive Attacks, Michael with double Rapid Strikes.

Vael considered coming around the corner to help, but realized he'd probably get shot as soon as he did, so paused to cast Missile Shield on himself.  As soon as he emerged, the last two crossbowmen used their Wait maneuvers to drill him, and missed due to the spell.  After laughing at them, Vael cast Grease into the swarm of guards.  Meanwhile, two of the acolytes in the back were casting spells of their own: Dispel Magic, trying to take out whatever buffs the PCs had.  Both succeeded by slim margins, and failed to knock the Bless off any of the four PCs in the area of effect, as Ioannes outrolled them.  They also failed to dispel Vael's Trace.

Michael and Vallium continued cutting into the swarm, aided by the defense penalty for Grease.  Uvash meanwhile started smashing skulls, failing to one-shot kill any unwounded guards, but knocking a few unconscious.  Vael, seeing the acolytes in the back casting more spells, followed up his Grease with a Smoke, trying to mess up everyone's concentration.


Battle after Grease (right circle) and Smoke (left circle) were cast


At some point the remaining Settites started fleeing west down the stairs.  All the sergeants and acolytes and a couple of the guards got away, while Michael and Vallium and Uvash cut down the stragglers.

Vael checked his Trace and saw that Susarra's head was still down and west.  The Right for Riches Company started down the wide stairs after the Settites.  There were realistic busts of (mostly) older men flanking both sides of the stairs, probably Settite priests.  Uvash wanted to spend some time smashing them, but the others pressed him to hurry up and pursue.  As they continued down, the stairs bent left, from west to southwest and then south.  And the busts were replaced by some stuffed heads of various creatures: reptilian humanoids, one with horns, a bat, even a frost giant.  The frost giant head was enchanted, and started swearing in several languages (some the PCs knew, and some they didn't) as they approached.  Uvash put some leftover goat meat into its mouth to attempt to shut it up, but it didn't work.

As the stairs debouched into a wide Forum, the party saw a passage running east to a portcullis, with a couple of guys in leather armor behind it.  At the bottom of the stairs were a mass of guards, including the ones that just fled plus some more.  Beyond the guards was a huge statue of Set in Set animal form, with several slaves chained to it.  It appeared they may have finally reached the Forum of Set.

We paused there due to time.

GM's Comments:

As expected, the Settites reinforced the guard post in front of their temple.  Not well enough though.  The PCs decided to continue down the stairs rather than retreating to Gosterwick after the second battle, figuring they didn't have enough exploration or loot to earn any XP, and that they should do some more damage or make some more progress.

Crossbows don't combine well with maces and shields.  Crossbows do great damage if they hit, but they take two hands, and it takes forever to ready a shield.  Without a shield, an unbalanced mace is a much worse weapon, as it can't both attack and parry in the same turn.  The cult of Set might consider swapping some maces for spears, or some shields for bucklers.

Sparky tasted better than he fought.


Achievements:

The PCs caught just a glimpse of the Forum of Set at the end of the session.  They haven't actually entered it or seen most of it yet though.

XP:

None until they go back to town.  So far they have only visited a couple of new locations, grabbed a small amount of loot, and glimpsed the edge of the Forum of Set.

Next Week:

The Right for Riches Company appears to be invading the Forum of Set.  Do they smash a major faction of Arden Vul, or get swarmed and make new PCs?  I have no idea.

We resumed the battle with the Right for Riches company having chased the retreating Settites down the Sighing Stair into the Forum of Set.  At that point the party paused, because there was a portcullis on their left side and they were worried about being surrounded if they continued.  The Settites also paused at the bottom of the stairs, to form up and load crossbows.


Start of the battle


After aiming for a bit, the Settites loosed a volley of crossbow bolts.  Vallium was missed due to his Amulet of Missile Shield.  Vael was behind a wall to the west and out of line of sight, so didn't receive any shots.  Ioannes, Michael, and Uvash each dodged, blocked, or were missed by a couple of bolts.  The Settites dropped their crossbows and readied their melee weapons as they surged forward.

Meanwhile the Settites behind the portcullis to the east rang an alarm gong to summon more guards.  Not wanting to deal with assault from that direction, Vael cast Smoke on those guards, distracting them and wrecking their line of sight.  The one with the gong kept ringing it though.


Vael casts Smoke onto the Set Guildsmen to the east

Uvash used his Divine Grace, which gave him +7 to DX for 13 turns.  With only a short period with Super Dwarf available, the PCs surged forward to meet the mass of Settites at the bottom of the stairs.  Michael readied an Alchemist Fire potion and threw it at one of the Settites.  He missed, but there were so many that it landed in another Settite's hex behind the target, doing some splash damage.

Melee at the bottom of the stairs.  Set animal statue (with prisoners chained to it), Forum stalls (SW), and Forum food vendors (SE) visible

The Right of Riches Company had their shields, while most of the Settite guards had dropped theirs to fire crossbows and had not had a chance to pick them back up, so the PCs were at an advantage.  They cut down a few guards, killing a couple and knocking a couple of others unconcious, but a bunch more approached from the south and southeast.  When things started getting a bit lopsided, Vael threw a Smoke south of the stairs to slow the reinforcements, but the Settites started coming up the stairs and flanked Michael.


The Smoke slows further reinforcements, but there are enough to surround Michael, as the other PCs start falling back.

While surrounded by several Settites, Michael fell down, and appeared doomed.  He managed to regain his feet, but was reeling from his wounds, so his Move and Dodge were reduced.  He was a bit far for Uvash or Ioannes to heal him.  As he tried running up the stairs toward his comrades, one of the Settite guards appeared to hit him cleanly in the back for serious damage -- but Michael's Bless spell averted the attack.  Vael dropped a Grease on the stairs, while caused many of the Settites to fall and others to move more slowly, while Michael's Ring of Free Action let him keep going.  Eventually Michael got close enough to Uvash and Ioannes that they were able to drop a Stop Bleeding and a Major Healing on him, healing him enough to get his full Move back.  At that point Michael was as fast as the Settites, and the other PCs were faster, so they were able to escape up the stairs, with a swarm of Settites in tow.

The Right for Riches Company made it to the top of the Sighing Stair, ran east through the Temple of Set, then south and east past the barricade, then north into the desecrated Temple of Thoth, then down the skinny secret passage to the east.  The faster PCs ran at full speed to buy themselves a few seconds.  Ioannes and Uvash both cast Lend Energy on Vael, who was ready to cast Magelock on the door as soon as Michael came through it.

Unfortunately, right as the lead PCs came out the secret door, Roskelly and several of his halfling toll collector thugs were standing right in that area, looking at the statue.  They immediately started talking about tolls and dungeoneering licenses and asking where the PCs came from, since they hadn't come down the stairs from the Pyramid of Thoth.  Vael pulled out his Dungeoneering License pin and flashed it at Roskelly and said they were a little busy with pursuing Settites right now.  That caused the halflings to take a few steps back toward their territory.  Michael came running through the door, Vallium slammed it closed, and Vael cast Magelock on it.  As they heard the Settites start trying to break the door down, the PCs discussed whether to go north toward the stairs up to the basement, or south to the pyramid teleporter to the Well of Light.  They went toward the basement, and the halflings let them go.

Having not found significant loot or explored much new territory, the Right for Riches company decided to keep delving rather than heading back to towh.  Rather than going upstairs to the basement, they headed east to the bridge over the chasm, and back into the room with the baboon-headed Thoth statue.  Vallium dug through his notes looking for the statue arm settings that opened a door last time, while Vael tried Lockmaster on a locked door to the north.  The spell unexpectedly failed, but a second attempt was a critical success and unlocked the door.  After listening at the door, Vallium went north into a room with 3 sarcophagi.  He motioned the others to stay back, indicating that if there were any arrow traps he didn't want anyone getting hit.  He then pulled the lid off the nearest sarcophagus.  He got a glimpse at a (non-moving) mummy, as tons of sand started pouring out of the ceiling.  Vael and Ioannes, who had been just inside the room, hopped out.  Vallium ran for the exit, which took him about three seconds, through rapidly rising sand, but he made it without falling.  As they looked into the room from the corridor outside they saw that it was buried under many tons of sand.  Vael said they could come back another time with digging tools and digging spells, but for now they should try another way.

They went back into the room with the statue and manipulated its arms to a few different positions.  Two positions each caused a secret door to open and an ibis-headed Guardian of Thoth to emerge to attack them, but the fights were five on one and the Guardians were not that hard to defeat.  A third position caused a door leading east to unlock, and the group went down a passage.

They went past a room to the north with previously looted sarcophagi, then past a large room where Vael had previously defeated a statue by Levitating out of reach, then past a Continually Lit room with a fountain that had given Uvash donkey ears, before finding a new room to the north.  The room had frescoes on all the walls featuring the exploits of the Archontean folk hero Larel One-Eye, who both Vallium and Ioannes recognized.  There were also a cloak rack with several cloaks; a chest; a weapons rack with a variety of knives; a desk with a golden apple, a silver letter opener, and some letters; and a pedestal with a funerary urn on it.  Vael and Ioannes went around the room looking for magic, and found that several of the knives and a couple of the cloaks looked magical, as did the apple.  Vallium checked to see if any of the items looked like the ones on the walls, and a multi-colored cloak looked like Larel's cloak, while one of the knives looked like Larel's stiletto.  Ioannes thought the multi-colored cloak might be magical, while Vael was pretty sure it wasn't, but Vallium put it on and turned invisible.  That settled the debate.  Vael declared that something in the room was interfering with magic detection, and they should take everything.  The letters on the desk all claimed to be from Larel to three different women, and all used the exact same phrasing with only the name changed.  Vael Apportated the chest open and found some clothing; inside a stocking cap Ioannes found a sack.  He reached into the sack and pulled out a rock, and decided the sack was special.  The urn did not appear magical, and the party left that behind.  They searched under the desk and along all the walls, then continued east.

There were doors north and east.  Behind the north door were spiral stairs up.  Vallium decided to go up.  This led them to an area they'd found before, northeast of the Well of Light.  There they remembered a secret door that they had found (with magical assistance after performing the Litany of Light) but never opened.  Vael figured out how to open it, and they opened it to reveal stairs up, with Thothian frescoes.

At the top of the stairs was a a large and interesting room.  There were two rows of statues of Archontean heroes of the past, with a few of the statues missing.  There were also several old corpses in the room.  Iaonnes inspected the bodies and thought they had been violently killed by something strong.  The bodies contained some weapons and armor, a few coins, a couple of potions, and a scroll.  Vael looked everything over and detected a magic sling and a magic shield.  The group then started looking around the edges of the room.  There were eight shrines, but seven of them were closed off behind some kind of magical force fields.  The one that was open contained a book and a quill and some Mithric writing.  Everyone decided to leave the shrine alone for now and come back later.  There was also a large statue of Thoth in ibis-headed form, with some orange gas descending from its beak, and some Mithric writing about pneuma.  Vael said that he had some theories about the statue and the shrine but they should leave for now and come back later.

They went back down to the Well of Light level, then went west and south to the actual Well of Light without encountering any baboons, and Vael cast Flight on Vallium and Michael and Levitation on himself, and everyone flew up the Well, with Vallium and Michael carrying Ioannes and Uvash.  They walked south across the ruins of Arden Vul, climbed down the Cliff Face (with Ioannes using his Luck to avoid a careless fall) and hiked back to Gosterwick.  They met another patrol of Knights of the Azure Shield on the Imperial Road before reaching town, but the Knights just asked them for news of the Settites and let them pass.

For security, Vallium, Uvash, and Michael moved out of the Yellow Cloak Inn and moved into the Arcane Practitioners Club with Vael and Ioannes.  They resolved to treat Gosterwick as a dangerous place after Susarra's murder and try to watch each other's backs.  Vael started analyzing all the items they recovered, casting Analyze Magic multiple times per item in case the magic concealing effect interfered with it.  It appeared that Larel's Cloak, Larel's Sack, and Larel's Pin (the letter opener) were quite powerful items.

GM's Comments:

Superior numbers are good.  The Right for Riches Company appear to be better than Settites, but not better than dozens and dozens of Settites.

I was pretty sure Michael was toast when he was significantly separated from the rest of the party with a whole lot of Settites in between, but Bless and heavy armor and some lucky die rolls and Grease and the Ring of Free Action, plus some timely healing spells, saved him.

I thought it would be hilarious if the PCs took all of Larel's decoy items and missed the concealed good ones, but Ioannes rolled a critical success on a Per+Magery roll, and Vallium thought to correlate the items in the frescoes with the items in the room, and Vael then declared they should take everything in the room even if they didn't think it was magical (except the urn), so that didn't happen.

I think the players were more excited to find a new stairway up than they were to find unguarded magic items.

Achievements:
1 XP for reaching the Forum of Set, an Arden Vul Iconic Location

XP:
1 XP for exploration, for finding 10 new locations
1-2 XP for loot, depending on how much they sell
1 XP for an achievement 
3-4 XP total

Next Week:

They have a lot of options.  They can go after the Set Cult again, or deal with the halflings, or try to revisit the goblins, or explore more of the Halls of Thoth east of the chasm, or go back to the Hall of Shrines.  Or a half-dozen other places.  Arden Vul is big.

DFRPG Bonus Downtime Recap: Strange Happenings in Gosterwick
There's this idea in DFRPG that Town is a "safe zone".  PCs can shop and train there and don't have to worry about being robbed or murdered.

Is that true in Gosterwick, 10 miles south of the ruins of Arden Vul?  Apparently not.

The Right for Riches company returned to Gosterwick after their successful mission to rescue Canon Lillian of the Church of Mitra from the dungeons of the Cult of Set. This mission incidentally resulted in the deaths of about a dozen Settites guarding the path to Lillian's cell, plus about a dozen more Settites in the nearby Temple of Set who just happened to be doing the wrong evil ritutal in the wrong place at the wrong time.  And a giant crocodile who took advantage of the chaos to try to eat an allied NPC.  While the PCs were in the Temple of Set, they also stole anything valuable looking that wasn't too heavy, including a couple of gigantic and incredibly valuable rubies from the largest cult statue's eyes.  And some of the PCs may or may not have urinated on a holy altar of Set; the stories are inconsistent.





(Artistic interpretation of Uvash and Ioannes stealing the ruby eyes of the cult statue in the Temple of Set, over the corpse of the giant crocodile Susarra killed, while Vael, Michael, Vallium, and an unidentified NPC discuss their next move.)
It appears that the Cult of Set was not happy about any of this.  A few days after the Right for Riches Company returned to Gosterwick, two things happened:

Coinbase, leader of the Grudge Brigade Mercenary Company, received an anonymous offer under his door.  It promised a payment of $2500 each for Vael, Vallium, Ioannes, Uvash, Michael, or Susarra, dead or alive.  They or their remains should be brought to the Duty Deacon in the Forum of Set, who would then contact the Pontifex to verify the identify of the invader and pay the reward.  (Coinbase decided to sell the contract to Vael rather than acting on it.)
Susarra was decapitated in her bed at the Yellow Cloak Inn.  Her head and the more valuable and portable parts of her gear were missing.  Vallium, who the innkeeper had seen with Susarra, was called in to identify the body, and then Vael showed up and asked for a blood sample from the victim.  His request was initially denied by the guards at the crime scene, while one of them added Vael's name to A List.  Later that denial was overruled by Audun Yellow-Eyes, head of the Drome in Gosterwick, who sent a blood sample to Vael.
Once he got the blood sample, Vael cast Seeker followed by Trace, revealing that Susarra's head was currently in a backpack tossed in a corner of a comfortable room, about ten miles north of Gosterwick.  Vael could maintain the Trace spell as long as he could stay awake, but could not cast Seeker again for a week, so he advocated cutting short the usual week of downtime between delves and immediately going after whoever murdered Susarra.

To be continued...

# DFRPG Arden Vul Session 23A: Gelatinous Cube and Slime Kraken

Date: 
Basilsday, 16th of Gerakios, 2993 AE 


Weather: 

Hot, dry


Player Characters: 

Lillian, captured Canon of Mitra
Kronos, Innkeeper at the Sign of the Broken Head
4 Ghouls
Gelatinous Cube
Slime Kraken
Susarra, Archontean fighter
Several Set guards


Vallium formulated a plan to rescue Lillian.  They would avoid the halflings, bribe the beastmen (who rumor claimed had taken Lillian) with food for information on Lillian or for her release, bring her back to the Church of Mitra, and profit.

The first part of the plan went pretty well.  They loaded up their mule with food and took it up to the ruins of Arden Vul.  Not wanting to take the mule into the Halls, they instead took it to the Sign of the Broken Head and paid Kronos for boarding.  They then loaded the food into a wheelbarrow, went down through the basement entrance to avoid the halflings, and headed south toward the beastmen.

On the way, they searched for secret doors in the Thothian burial niches, and found one.  Opening it up found a crypt containing some elaborate sarcophagi and 4 angry ghouls.  The ghouls surprised Michael, but failed to hurt him.  A quick battle ensued, with Michael and Vallium smacking down the ghouls.  The grave goods included a couple of magical white gold rings, a high quality spear, and some silver torcs and alabaster urns.  The party took the light loot and left the heavy stuff in the secret tomb to grab on the way out.

As they approached beastman territory, Vael cast Seeker looking for Lillian.  The spell showed her bound, gagged, and injured, in a prison cell.  It said the cell was somewhere to the northwest, away from the beastmen.  Vael followed up the Seeker with a Trace so he could keep homing in on Lillian.  At that point they decided to turn around and not talk to the beastmen after all, since it appeared they didn't have Lillian.

They went north and west until they reached the room with 3 portcullises and 3 levers.  Vael, who hadn't been there before, wanted to go up the stairs to the south, but Vallium explained that it led to parts of the Well of Light lever that they had not fully explored, and pulled him back on target.  Vael, not wanting to touch anything he didn't have to, used Apportation to move the middle lever and open the middle portcullis.  They then headed west into a maze of catacombs, filled with burial niches whose plugs had been removed.  Knowing it would take forever to search all the niches, everyone kept their eyes open for obvious doors or treasure, but nobody took time to search.

At one point Uvash was in the lead and almost ran right into a nearly invisible form ahead.  He saw some coins just hanging in the air, and stopped before becoming enveloped.  It was a large gelatinous cube.  Uvash backed away and called for help, as the others ran up.  The cube was huge but fairly slow.  Uvash was a bit worried that it might damage his fancy mace, but took a swing at it anyway, and did a bit of damage.  Michael and Vallium ran up and started rapidly hacking at it.  It kept trying to hit them with slimy pseudopods, but didn't aim very well.  Eventually they hit it enough that it slowed down further and stopped dodging effectively, and then they just kept hitting it until it stopped twitching.

There were some coins and gems inside the cube's body, along with a wand.  Michael, wearing heavy armor and a Ring of Free Action, was able to crawl in and grab the gems and wand without getting hurt, but his armor was smoking a bit.  Manually getting all the coins didn't seem worth the risk, but since coins are pretty sturdy, Vael used Create Fire to just melt the remains of the cube to ash, and they picked the coins out of the remains.

They found a door heading south, but it had no obvious handle, did not budge when they tried pushing it open, and appeared too strong to break down without mining tools.  Vael tried using Apportation to push the door in every direction, but his spell failed to move the door.  Giving up, the group resumed walking around the catacombs looking for secret doors.  Ioannes found one to the northwest, but it led to stairs down, and Vael was pretty sure Lillian was on this level, so they didn't go that way.

Giving up on finding another door, they went back to the heavy door, and Vael used Shape Earth to dig a small tunnel through the rock a few yards away from the door.  His first couple of tries didn't go far enough, but eventually he managed to dig a small tunnel through to another room.  Vallium volunteered to crawl through it first, and didn't find anything dangerous in the room, just the bodies of a couple of humans and a couple of ghouls.  Everyone else crawled in, and they looted a shortsword and a ring.  There was a door on the north wall, which led to a short passage and then the door they had been unable to open from the other side.  From this side, it was possible to push it open with enough effort.  However, it closed itself shortly after they stopped pushing on it, and nobody had any spikes to keep it open.

Heading east, they found another room with doors south and east.  The southern door was spiked shut.  Vael confirmed that Lillian was still southwest, so they pulled the spikes and went south.  They saw doors south and west.  The western room was small and completely trashed.

To the south, however, was a very large room, containing a circular pool with a statue of Thoth inside it.  The temple had been thoroughly and deliberately trashed, and both clerics felt like it was a place of negative sanctity.  There was some anti-Thoth graffiti on the walls, and a picture of a crocodile eating an ibis, indicating that the vandalism was probably the work of Settites.  Worse, when Vallium went into the room, a lot of tentacles emerged from the pool to grab him.  Everyone retreated back north out of the room, with Vallium chopping off a couple of the tentacles as he parried their attacks.

After some discussion, the group decided they needed to get past the tentacle beast, but since they now knew it was there, they could buff themselves first.  Vael would cast Great Haste on the fighters, while Ioannes cast Flaming Weapon.  Vael flubbed his first couple of attempts to Great Haste Michael, but the third try worked, and then Michael opened the door and charged south.  He ran right into the pool, not slowed because of his Ring of Free Action, and started cutting off tentacles as the slime kraken tried dragging him under.  At one point it looked like Michael critically failed an attack and crippled his own shield arm, but his Bless spell sacrificed itself and prevented the self-inflicted attack.  A few seconds later, Vallium also came charging into the room at double speed, and now the slime beast was surrounded.  Both Vallium and Michael kept cutting off tentacles, then went after its body.  With all its tentacles gone, the beast started biting with its beak.  Uvash used Divine Grace then followed them into the room, but Michael finished the slime creature off with multiple rapid strikes from behind before Uvash arrived.

With the battle over, Vael was very tired after casting multiple Great Hastes, and Vallium and Michael were tired from fighting.  While they rested, Ioannes started searching and found a magical sheet of yellow glass in the pool.  Rather than reaching into the murky water, he Apportated it out.  After resting, everyone started circling the room and looking for secret doors.  Vael found a secret door in the north wall, with a small empty alcove behind it.  Later he searched in the same spot on the south wall and found a matching secret door and empty alcove.  There were doors in all four corners of the rooms.  Both of the ones on the east side led to ramps up to galleries overlooking the temple.  One of the ramps had a bit of adventuring equipment left on it, and Vallium grabbed some spikes.

The most promising door, in the southwest corner, led to a small passage south, another door, and a cave-in.  The cave in was large enough that Vael did not feel he could use Shape Earth to get past it.  Everyone returned to the temple and searched again for secret doors.  They did not find any, but Uvash spotted an iron key in the fountain, which Vael Apportated out, dried off, and added to their keyring.

Giving up on manually searching, Vael pulled out the Wand of See Secrets and used a charge.  At that point a secret door to the southwest and a peephole high on the west wall became obvious to him.  He ran around the temple while the spell lasted, finding another secret door off the southeast gallery.  He then doubled back north through the other rooms they had searched.  He did not find any more secret doors there.  There was one door to the east which they had not opened, and, caution thrown aside while racing the spell duration, Vael opened it rather than waiting for Vallium and Michael to catch up.  There was an armed and armored woman hiding in the room.  Fortunately for Vael, she did not attack, and instead asked who he was and what he was doing there.  Vael didn't want to talk, as he was trying to find secret doors, but he explained that they were looking for Lillian.  The woman didn't know who Lillian was, but said that her name was Susarra and her friends had been killed by ghouls and she was looking for a way out past the tentacle monster.  When Vael indicated that they had killed the monster and invited her to tag along, she followed him out of the room.

They listened to the southwestern secret door, opened it, and found a room full of trash.  There were some footprints leading from the secret door to the middle of the room, then vanishing.  Everyone started searching for more secret doors.  While searching, Vallium triggered a spear trap.  It barely penetrated his helmet, scratching his face.  Vallium broke the spear in half to make sure that didn't happen again.  They eventually found a concealed door on the south wall.

When they opened the door, a trap went off, and gas started pouring into the room with a loud hiss.  Everyone managed to hold their breath before breathing any of the gas, and then Vael cast a Purify Air to clear the room.  The group went south through the door, and saw some Set guards in their distinctive red scale armor, looking angry.  There wasn't enough time left in the session to fight the battle, so the session ended there.


GM's Comments:

Slime Kraken might be my new favorite monster name.

Gelatinous Cubes are fun, but they're also slow and stupid, so unless they surprise you and get a free attack, or corner you, they're not as dangerous as they seem.

You would think that the combination of Seeker and Trace and Shape Earth would make reaching a prisoner within one four-hour session pretty easy.  Find the prisoner, head toward the prisoner, and if you can't find a way toward the prisoner, dig one.  But four hours flew by this week, despite only finishing three fights.


Achievements:

None

XP:

None until they get back to down, but they explored some new territory and found a bit of loot.


Next Week:

We know they'll be starting the session fighting those Set guards, and then, if they win, presumably resuming the search for Lillian.

# DFRPG Arden Vul Session 23B: Disrupting Services in the Temple of Set

Date: 
Basilsday, 16th of Gerakios, 2993 AE 


Weather: 

Hot, dry


Player Characters: 

Lillian, captured Canon of Mitra
Susarra, Archontean fighter
Many Set guards
Many Set cultists
Several Set acolytes
Several Set deacons

Continuing from the previous session, Vallium came through the gas-trapped doorway, with Vael, Ioannes, and Susarra close behind him.  Uvash and Michael were well behind.  There was one Set guard in red scale armor peering around a corner ahead, shouting back reports to his allies.  Vallium charged, while yelling for nobody to stand right behind him.  The guard waited until Vallium was two yards away to fire his crossbow -- and somehow missed.  Whether this was due to Vallium's Amulet of Missile Shield, or the guard just panicking, was hard to tell.

The guard backed around the corner.  There was a short staircase up, with a 4' tall barricade at the top, and several more guards behind the barricade, holding crossbows.  A couple more took shots at Vallium as he and the first guard ran up the stairs, then dropped their crossbows and pulled out maces or potions.  Meanwhile Michael and Uvash caught up to Vael, who cast Great Haste on Michael.

Vallium neared the barricade as a couple of the guards threw down Alchemist's Fire potions, but missed him.  By then Michael was double-timing up the stairs behind him, and Vael was near the bottom of the steps casting a Grease spell.  The Set deacon at the top of the stairs concentrated on a spell for a couple of seconds, so Vallium let go of his sword (letting it hang from a lanyard), reached into his potion belt, and smashed a Magebane potion.  This emitted a sickly smoke that kept everyone within a few yards of Vallium from casting wizard spells for a while -- but the caster was a cleric and was not affected.  He finished his Dispel Magic spell, catching Vallium and Michael and Susarra in it.  He was trying to dismiss Vallium's Missile Shield (which failed because it was a permanent magic item, not a spell) and Michael's Great Haste.  The attempt was successful, and also dismissed a couple of Continual Light rocks as well as Vallium's Bless.

It didn't get the Grease though, which was cast behind the barricade outside the area of effect of the Dispel, and the guards started slipping and sliding.  Michael stabbed the one on the stairs.  Vallium recovered his sword and hit a couple behind the barricade.  Susarra got to the barricade and got a couple of axe swings in.  As the battle turned against his side, the deacon commanded one of the unwounded guards to run north and set reinforcements.  A badly wounded guard broke ranks and followed him.  After taking a hit, the deacon retreated west.  Uvash reached the top and opened the gate in the barricade, and the party poured through.  They eventually took down all but one of the guards, but the one survivor ran north into an area with a red tiled floor, pulled open a black curtain, and ran into the large room beyond while yelling for help.

Vallium used his Ring of Illusion Disguise to look like the cleric they had just defeated, whose guards had called Deacon Hurub.  He followed the guard into the big temple room to the north while yelling "The Azure Knights are attacking, there are too many, retreat."  A couple of set clerics were leading many cultists in a service nearby.  Many of the cultists broke and ran in various directions.  Vallium waited at the curtain for a few seconds, while Vael cast Great Haste on both Vallium and Michael, and Ioannes followed up with Flaming Weapon.  Once they were fully buffed, everyone ran into the temple.  Michael chased the retreating guard to the west, trailed by Vael, and eventually caught and killed him, but by then about eight more guards were streaming out of two rooms north and south.  Uvash and Ioannes and Susarra went east toward a huge statue of Set in Set animal form, and killed a few cultists.  Vallium chased some clerics to the northeast into a room with a portcullis, and killed them both before they got it open.  There was a brief difference of opinion about who was the real cleric of Set and who was the traitor or imposter, but Vallium won the argument using his sword, and the nearby cultists helped him finish off the acolyte.

Michael was beset by a lot of guards, but he had Great Haste, and Vael cast two Grease spells and a Smoke spell among the guards to help him.  Michael eventually downed all of them.  Meanwhile Susarra ran between two long rectangular pools to come help Michael, when a huge crocodile unexpectedly emerged from one of the pools and tried to eat her.  She avoided being surprised and eventually killed it with a couple of solid axe blows.  A second crocodile came out later, and she wounded it badly enough that it went back under the water to hide and wait for easier prey.

Uvash and Ioannes, after running out of nearby cultists, decided to try to desecrate the evil temple.  Ioannes first tried to knock over the huge statue, but it was just too heavy.  They then decided to take its ruby eyes.  The statue was 25' tall, so its eyes were well out of reach.  Uvash climbed up the statue with his Ring of Climbing, then dropped a rope to help Ioannes up, since Ioannes had the Apportation spell and could take the rubies without actually touching them.  This plan worked, and Ioannes magically grabbed two huge rubies and dropped them in Uvash's pouch, before climbing back down.  Ioannes then stole everything he could find on the Settites' evil sacrificial altar.  He and Uvash then knocked it over.

Vallium chased down and killed two more deacons who were trying to escape down a wide staircase to the west, then dragged them back into the temple and took their portable valuables.  He and Vael shut the huge bronze doors, and Vael Magelocked them.  Vael ran around the room looking for magic items, and Susarra explored the temple looking for other valuables.  Everyone then retreated to the room to the south, outside the temple's Set-aligned sanctity, to rest and heal.  Both Michael and Susarra were fairly wounded, so Ioannes used Stop Bleeding and Major Healing to patch them up.

After the long battle, and with the Set Cult fully alerted to their presence, it was time to decide whether to head back to Gosterwick or press on looking for Lillian.  The group unanimously decided to keep looking for Lillian rather than retreating, so they ended the session, very close to where they started it, but surrounded by a lot of dead Settites (and one dead crocodile).


GM's Comments:

This was by far the biggest battle we've fought in this campaign, 5 PCs and an NPC against over 20 Settites and a couple of crocodiles.  It took almost the whole session.  I should have taken some screenshots.



Achievements:

None


XP:

None until they get back to town, but they explored even more new territory and found some more loot.


Next Week:

They're pretty sure they're close to Lillian now, so they're going to try to rescue her and get out before whatever portion of the Set cult is left gets their revenge.

We resumed in the dungeon, after the party killed or chased off everyone in the Temple of Set and spent a few minutes looting.  The group retreated south out of the temple, back into the guard room atop the barricade, where until the sanctity level (for non-Settites) went back to normal, then rested.  They then searched the western wall, where the Set deacon had been running, and found a door concealed behind a screen.  They went west through a torture chamber, then through a black curtain into some kind of waiting room with pews, then south into a robing room.  There were some red Settite robes there, but not enough for everyone, and Uvash refused to wear them anyway.  With some of the group disguised and some not, they searched for secret doors and found one on the south wall, leading to a narrow spy corridor. Heading west, they found some peepholes into a prison, with seven cells, six prisoners (including Lillian), and four guards.  Without a way into the prison from here, they doubled back north, east, and then south down some stairs.

Suddenly some candles lining the stairs start smoking, and loud screams came from somewhere.  Magically alerted, several guards poured out of a room to the southeast.  A six-on-six battle commenced.  Susarra, Vallium, and Michael filled the corridor to the south, with Uvash, Vael, and Ioannes behind them.  On the other side were 4 Set guards, a Set torturer with a long whip, and a Set wizard who was throwing Force Missiles at Michael from the doorway.




The Set ranks held for a few seconds, while Vael cast Great Haste on Michael.  Then once Michael started attacking twice as fast, he downed an enemy and charged forward to get the wizard, while Uvash moved up to fill the hole on the left.  Vallium and Susarra kept holding the line and stabbing Settites, and Ioannes cast several Stop Bleeding and Major Healing spells to keep his allies up.  As the Settites started to fall, they yelled for help, and reinforcements started coming from the west.  It was the four guards the party had seen before, plus a jailer they had not spotted.




As the original Settites to the east fell, the battle moved west toward the approaching reinforcements.  Vael dropped a Grease spell in the hallway, which resulted in several Settites missing attack or defense rolls or falling over.  Michael, with his Ring of Free Action, was unaffected by the bad footing, and mercilessly hacked through the Settites before his Great Haste could run out.  Susarra and Uvash and Vallium followed behind him, staying out of the Grease but helping finish the Settites.  Eventually, all 11 of the Settites went down.

Vael and Michael were exhausted after the battle, so took a few minutes to rest, with Ioannes casting Lend Energy.  Once everyone could stand up, they took a preliminary pass over the bodies looking for magical loot, then they went west.  They heard a woman yelling from behind an open door to the north.  In the room was the jailer's prisoner Eadgithu, manacled to the wall.  Vallium grabbed the jailer's key ring and tried keys until one freed her, at which point Eadgithu thanked them and went to grab a sword off the jailer's body.  Vael saw a lockbox in the room and cautiously opened it using the keys and an Apportation spell, finding some coins and gems and a spellbook.  The group then went west to the prison.

There were 6 prisoners visible.  Three of them (Lillian, an overweight man, and a tough-looking man) were manacled to the back of their cells and gagged.  The other three (a goblin, a fishman, and a well-muscled dwarf) were not tied or gagged.  Half of the prisoners showed obvious wounds, while the others appeared to be in better shape.  Vallium used the jailer's keys to free Lillian first, and Ioannes healed her wounds.  She then explained who some of the other prisoners were.  She said the tough-looking man was Azgallatu, a warrior cleric of Mitra who had been captured trying to find her, and he should definitely be freed.  She stated that the goblin (who showed no wounds) was some high-ranking noble captive, at which point Gribble interrupted to introduce himself and said he was the brother of King Wiskenim, who would certainly reward his rescuers.  Lillian and Gribble agreed that the fishman was unfriendly and also didn't seem to speak any languages they knew, so he was left in his cell.  The overweight man was Geleg, a wizard, who when ungagged immediately thanked his rescuers then asked if anyone had seen his spellbook.  Vael admitted to having found a spellbook but asked if he could copy any spells, and Geleg immediately agreed to let Vael copy anything he wanted.  The dwarf seemed a bit unfriendly, so Vallium passed the keys to Uvash to deal with him.  Grist asked Uvash several questions, apparently suspicious that he might be a doppleganger, before agreeing that he was an actual dwarf and warming up slightly.  He was badly wounded, so he appreciated the healing spell Ioannes gave him.  Azgallatu, when freed, thanked the party then immediately took up position at Lillian's side.

With a horde of rescued prisoners in tow, the party went back east to loot the room at the bottom of the stairs.  There were several heads mounted on the walls, of a lion, some kind of reptile man, a member of Gog's species, and a goblin.  The goblin head appeared to be magical.  Gribble wanted to throw it in a nearby disposal hole, but because it was magical Vael argued that it couldn't be left where the Settites could recover it, so Gribble reluctantly put it in a chest (where he didn't have to look at it) and carried it out.  Meanwhile each of the other prisoners was asked to carry a suit of red Set scale armor.  So burdened, the group went back north up the stairs, east over the barricade, north through the gas-trapped room (the trap had not reset), and back into the desecrated temple of Thoth were the slime kraken had been killed.

There was some debate on whether to go north or east.  Vallium argued that east was closer to the halflings so north was safer.  Ioannes countered that with so many of them, the halflings would probably be too scared to fight.  But the decision was made to go north and try to avoid contact.  Vael re-cast Shape Earth to cover the ends of the passage he had made next to the one-way door, and everyone went north through the one-way door then east through the catacombs to the portcullis.  They closed the portcullis behind them, then went south through the burial niches to the secret room where they had stashed a wheelbarrow full of food.

Vael and Vallium wanted to give the food to someone rather than waste it, so they asked Lillian the story of her capture.  She said she had been looking for Settite activity when she had been grabbed by the Green Fang Kobolds, who traded her to the beastmen, who traded her to the Settites, who threw her in their jail and tortured her.  This dropped everyone's opinion of the beastmen, and they decided to give the food to Gog instead of the beastmen.  They instructed everyone to leave the heavy scale armor in the secret door, grabbed the wheelbarrow of food, and headed south and east to the concealed door behind the baboon fresco.  They took the hidden stairs down to the Cave of Gog.

Gog heard them coming, and was waiting outside the secret door when it opened.  He was pleased to see the wheelbarrow of food and asked if it was for him.  Pleased to hear that he was, he got his boat and had them dump all the food from the wheelbarrow into it.  Gribble said that goblin territory was just to the south and asked if the party would like to meet his brother the king.  The other freed prisoners were not so enthusiastic about tromping through goblin territory, but they didn't want to go back to Gosterwick without their heavily armed escort either, so they came along.  Gribble led them south into a room full of many goblins, who enthusiastically greeted him.  Their leader led Gribble and his huge entourage east to Killik, the Boss of the Wet Caves.  Killik then appointed one of the other goblin captains Temporary Boss and went with Gribble down a long staircase to Goblintown.

Arriving in Goblintown, Killik and Gribble led the party through a confusing maze of passages.  At one point they were led across a rickety bridge "maybe not so strong for big people go one at a time."  Uvash actually broke one slat of the bridge when crossing it, but managed not to fall.  They eventually reached a room with ogre guards outside, where the goblin major-domo, Pelestrim, greeted Gribble and went into the room to arrange an audience.  A minute later, Gribble and his rescuers were invited in to meet King Weskenim.

King Weskenim asked Gribble a lot of questions in Goblin, then thanked his rescuers in accented Archontean, and said he wasn't prepared for their arrival but promised them a reward next time they visited.  He also mentioned the need to recover the Scepter of the Goblins.  When Vael asked if the goblins knew about any other entrances to the Halls, Weskenim said that was a sore point, that Plumthorn's Halflings were squatting on his rightful entrance to the surface, and needed to be removed.  After hearing how many Settites they had killed, he said the Right for Riches company were just the halfling exterminators he needed and to please take care of the infestation at their earliest convenience.  He warned them that the halflings had a wizard and used poison.  At some point during the meeting, Weskenim's cat jumped onto his shoulder, at which point the king had to end the meeting to play with the cat.

With the royal audience concluded, Killik led the party and their freed prisoners back up to the Wet Caves, this time taking a longer route that didn't involve any bridges that might not be strong enough for armored humans or dwarves.  At one point he rushed them past some kind of demon imprisoned in a summoning circle reciting obscure mathematical formulae, but didn't answer any questions.  They went back up to the Wet Caves, then back to Gog's Cave, where Gog was happily sorting his newly acquired food.  Gog ferried everyone across the underground stream in his boat, and they went upstairs, then out to the surface through the basement exit, then back to the Broken Head to get their mule, then back to the dam to stow their wheelbarrow, then finally back to Gosterwick.

In Gosterwick, Jador the Just at the Temple of Mitra was excited to see Lillian had been rescued, and detailed a lesser cleric to go with Ioannes to the Silent Factor and transfer the reward money to his account.  Anaximander, the ancient sage they had rescued previously, had been healed of his insanity, and was dictating the events of 250 years ago to some other clerics.  Vael asked for access to Anaximander, and Jador agreed to let him read the notes the clerics had compiled so far, and also personally visit him.  Lillian and Azgallatu said they would stay at the the Temple of Mitra for a few days before heading to Newmarket, while the other freed prisoners got rooms or bunkroom beds elsewhere in Gosterwick.


GM's Comments:

Another large battle, but not as large as last week.  Great Haste is still very good.  Grease is pretty good too.

I need to spend more time with the Foundry Token Attacher module so I can quickly make a train of NPCs follow a PC.

I was not really prepared for the PCs to go down to Goblintown (I should have been, since they were heading for Lillian and Gribble was in the next cell over, but I had wrongly assumed they would just let Gribble go rather than following him home) so had to scramble to find the right paths for everyone to take around the Goblintown map.  Since there wasn't a lot of time left in the session, I rushed through the first meeting with King Weskenim and had him invite them back for another one.


Achievements:

The Rescuers: for rescuing Susarra, Lillian, Gribble, Eadgithu, Geleg, and Grist.
Quest: for bringing Lillian back to the Temple of Mitra
Knockback: 1 XP to Uvash for the first hit with a blunt weapon hard enough to achieve knockback.  (This happened all the time in GURPS 3E, but is rarer in 4E and DFRPG due to some rules changes.)
XP:
Exploration: about 47 rooms (across 3 sessions) (many of them led through goblin territory), 2 XP
Loot: reward money, 2 giant rubies, coins and gems and weapons and armor: 2 XP
Achievements: 2 group achievements, 1 individual achievement for Uvash
Total: 7 XP for Uvash, 6 XP for Vael/Vallium/Ioannes, 4 XP for Michael (missed a session)

Next Week:

The PCs have a lot of options.  The obvious ones are to try to get their reward from King Weskenim, further battle the Cult of Set, or finally deal with Plumthorn's Halflings.  But they also have several parts of the Halls to explore.

# DFRPG Arden Vul Session 24A: Revenge on the Set Cult

Date: 
Mitrasday, 19th of Gerakios, 2993 AE 


Weather: 

Hot, dry


Player Characters: 

Jador the Just, chief priestess of Mitra in Gosterwick
Audun Yellow-Eyes, logothete of the House of Sight ("Drome") in Gosterwick
Freydis the Stern, steward of Lady Alexia Basileon in Gosterwick 
Four Knights of the Azure Shield
Seven beastmen
Many Set guards
Several Set acolytes
Several Set sergeants
Sparky the goat, mascot of Alpha Sept
Apophis the giant lizard
Two boars


After the murder of Susarra, the Right for Riches company decided to head back to Arden Vul before the Trace spell on her head wore off.  Knowing that he couldn't sleep without losing the Trace, Vael first went to the Temple of Mitra to see if any of the priests there could cast Vigil to let him go a night without sleep without ill effects.  Unfortunately, nobody there was able to cast Vigil.

The party then went to the House of Sight in Gosterwick where they were granted a meeting with the logothete, Audun Yellow-Eyes.  Audun explained that he was appalled by the murder of Susarra, but could not officially endorse an attack on Set, or lend any resources to one.  Also that if anyone asked about the vial of Susarra's blood sent to Vael, it wasn't him.

They continued to the Azure Keep to try to arrange a meeting with Lady Alexia.  Unfortunately, she was not available.  They did meet with her steward, Freydis the Stern, who gave her condolences on Susarra and said that she would pass along any inquiries to Lady Alexia when she returned.

With no help forthcoming, they headed out for Arden Vul just after sunset.  A few miles from the Cliff Face, they heard riders coming south down the Imperial Road toward their lights.  It was four Knights of the Azure Shield, who asked them to identify themselves, they had questions about Michael's red scale armor.  They were satisfied with the answer that the armor had come off a dead Settite and there hadn't been time to repaint it before the Settites killed their friend and required a late night attack.  The knights continued their patrol.

When they reached the Cliff Face, they saw lights halfway up the cliff, west of the waterfall, at the site of the Set cult's basket.  Vael Levitated up to try improve his triangulation on Susarra's head.  He was surprised to see that she was at the same elevation as the Set basket, and somewhere west, rather than up at the level of the ruins.  Vael flew back down to confer with the group.  They decided to go up to the ruins of Arden Vul, then back down though the basement, around the halflings, and through the desecrated Temple of Thoth to reach the Temple of Set.

Everyone (except Vael, who was still Levitating) tied themselves together for the night climb.  About halfway up the Long Stair, they encountered a beastman patrol heading down.  The beastmen formed up into a hedgehog formation as their sergeant asked the group to identify themselves.  He then indicated that his group would back up to a wider spot on the trail and allow the party distance to pass, as they were not looking for conflict.  This was agreed, and the Right for Riches company passed by the beastmen as they stood in defensive formation.  They continued to the top of the climb, then north across the ruins.

They group passed through the basement without encountering anything, then went down the spiral stair, west through the illusory wall, south through the destroyed remains of a one-way door.  They discussed going through the catacombs to stay farther from the halflings, but decided the secret door behind the Thoth statue was faster.  They were lucky enough not to meet any halflings, and went down the narrow secret passage west into the desecrated Temple of Thoth.  At that point they heard the blaring of a horn from the secret peephole high on the west wall -- their bright lights had been spotted.

The party quickly went south through a secret door, carefully picked their way through a formerly trapped room, and set off the gas trap again, which had been reset.  Nobody breathed any of the gas, though, and they continued south to the corner, then looked up west to see the barricade had been rebuilt and there were a mass of guards in red Set scale armor behind it, commanded by a sergeant, and accompanied by a goat.

The guards threw Alchemist's Fire flasks at Michael, Vallium, and Ioannes.  Michael was directly hit and set on fire, but he was wearing the Serpent's Amulet and didn't mind.  While the others hung back a bit, Michael started up the stairs.  Meanwhile Vael cast Shape Fire and started moving the rest of the boiling oil up the stairs toward the barricade.  Vallium went up the stairs behind the fire, warning the others not to stand directly behind him.  Uvash trailed Vallium off to one side, and Vael and Ioannes stayed well back.

As Vallium made himself a conspicuous target, he took several shots from crossbows.  He dodged several, trying not to give away that he had an an Amulet of Missile Shield.  Up against the barricade, Michael took a point-blank crossbow shot and failed to dodge it, resulting in a major wound to the chest.  He responded by stabbing the arbalester with his long sword.  The Vael-controlled fire wrecked the Settite line, as half the guards jumped to the sides to avoid the fire, and a couple failed to dodge it, caught on fire, and had to stop, drop, and roll to put it out.

Michael went over the barricade and stabbed a couple more guards.  Vallium followed him over and joined in.  Uvash and Ioannes came up behind, and Ioannes reached over the barricade to heal Michael twice, first with Stop Bleeding and then with Major Healing.  Vael stayed on the stairs and just sent his fire around the room harassing the guards, who occasionally failed to dodge and had to stop fighting for a bit to roll around on the ground.

Meanwhile Sparky the Goat decided to help his sept by charging into battle to slam the invaders with his horns.  Unfortunately for Sparky, Vallium and Michael had shields and heavy armor, so his slams were not enough to knock them over.  Worse, Sparky was not wearing armor, so when he got hit by the fire, the room smelled of burning goat.  After a bit of fire damage and a stray sword or mace shot, Sparky went down and did not get back up.

The Set sergeant recognized that his side was losing, and told one of his unwounded guards to run north to the temple and get reinforcements.  Vael responded by sending some of his fire after that guard to try to slow him down.  Eventually, the Settites lost 6 elite guards and a goat, while 2 guards and the sergeant managed to flee north.

As Uvash ate some singed goat, Vael checked his Trace and found that Susarra's head was down and west.  The Right for Riches company quickly regrouped to discuss their next move.  Did they chase north through the temple, or cut west and try to reach the stairs?  Taking a quick look through the burned curtains, they saw some cultists  fleeing west and a giant lizard chasing a boar.  Deciding to avoid that chaos, they went back into the room to the south and grabbed a couple of flasks of Alchemist's Fire and a couple of maces that Vael thought looked nice, plus a few silver coins from a chest.  After leaving some rude graffiti and setting a few cots on fire, they went west through the passages between the temple and the prison, trying to outflank the guards in the temple and reach the stairs down.

Unfortunately for them, the Settites had thought of this, and there was a large group of guards waiting on the wide stairs.  It was a dozen guards, four acolytes, and a couple of sergeants, including the one they had just been fighting.  About half the guards had crossbows ready, and one of the sergeants was yelling "nobody use fire."


Start of the battle on the wide stairs




Vallium, with his Amulet of Missile Shield, led the way, trying to draw more crossbow fire.  Michael followed behind, drawing his boomerang.  He threw it into the clump of guards, missing one near the front.  Unfortunately for the guards, it was a target-rich environment, and the boomerang missed or was dodged by two more guards, before it plunked one in the back who had no idea was was happening.  He fell down, momentarily stunned, and dropped his mace.

Four of the six guards with crossbows fired at Vallium.  He dodged all of the shots (some legitimately, some with magical help), before critically failing one Dodge roll and starting to fall down.  Realizing that he didn't want to be prone next to a pile of enemies, he used Luck to reroll the critical failure and avoid the fall.  The last two crossbowmen held their fire, as the sergeant said something about waiting for a better target.  The guards in the back with maces and shields ready started surging to the front.

Uvash prayed for his Heroic Grace and got a great result, +7 to DX for 13 turns.  He decided to use this temporary blessing to go for aimed shots at the skull and try to knock guards unconscious with one blow.  Meanwhile Michael and Vallium just went toe-to-toe with the front row of guards and started cutting them down, Vallium with single Deceptive Attacks, Michael with double Rapid Strikes.

Vael considered coming around the corner to help, but realized he'd probably get shot as soon as he did, so paused to cast Missile Shield on himself.  As soon as he emerged, the last two crossbowmen used their Wait maneuvers to drill him, and missed due to the spell.  After laughing at them, Vael cast Grease into the swarm of guards.  Meanwhile, two of the acolytes in the back were casting spells of their own: Dispel Magic, trying to take out whatever buffs the PCs had.  Both succeeded by slim margins, and failed to knock the Bless off any of the four PCs in the area of effect, as Ioannes outrolled them.  They also failed to dispel Vael's Trace.

Michael and Vallium continued cutting into the swarm, aided by the defense penalty for Grease.  Uvash meanwhile started smashing skulls, failing to one-shot kill any unwounded guards, but knocking a few unconscious.  Vael, seeing the acolytes in the back casting more spells, followed up his Grease with a Smoke, trying to mess up everyone's concentration.


Battle after Grease (right circle) and Smoke (left circle) were cast


At some point the remaining Settites started fleeing west down the stairs.  All the sergeants and acolytes and a couple of the guards got away, while Michael and Vallium and Uvash cut down the stragglers.

Vael checked his Trace and saw that Susarra's head was still down and west.  The Right for Riches Company started down the wide stairs after the Settites.  There were realistic busts of (mostly) older men flanking both sides of the stairs, probably Settite priests.  Uvash wanted to spend some time smashing them, but the others pressed him to hurry up and pursue.  As they continued down, the stairs bent left, from west to southwest and then south.  And the busts were replaced by some stuffed heads of various creatures: reptilian humanoids, one with horns, a bat, even a frost giant.  The frost giant head was enchanted, and started swearing in several languages (some the PCs knew, and some they didn't) as they approached.  Uvash put some leftover goat meat into its mouth to attempt to shut it up, but it didn't work.

As the stairs debouched into a wide Forum, the party saw a passage running east to a portcullis, with a couple of guys in leather armor behind it.  At the bottom of the stairs were a mass of guards, including the ones that just fled plus some more.  Beyond the guards was a huge statue of Set in Set animal form, with several slaves chained to it.  It appeared they may have finally reached the Forum of Set.

We paused there due to time.

GM's Comments:

As expected, the Settites reinforced the guard post in front of their temple.  Not well enough though.  The PCs decided to continue down the stairs rather than retreating to Gosterwick after the second battle, figuring they didn't have enough exploration or loot to earn any XP, and that they should do some more damage or make some more progress.

Crossbows don't combine well with maces and shields.  Crossbows do great damage if they hit, but they take two hands, and it takes forever to ready a shield.  Without a shield, an unbalanced mace is a much worse weapon, as it can't both attack and parry in the same turn.  The cult of Set might consider swapping some maces for spears, or some shields for bucklers.

Sparky tasted better than he fought.


Achievements:

The PCs caught just a glimpse of the Forum of Set at the end of the session.  They haven't actually entered it or seen most of it yet though.

XP:

None until they go back to town.  So far they have only visited a couple of new locations, grabbed a small amount of loot, and glimpsed the edge of the Forum of Set.

Next Week:

The Right for Riches Company appears to be invading the Forum of Set.  Do they smash a major faction of Arden Vul, or get swarmed and make new PCs?  I have no idea.

# DFRPG Arden Vul Session 24B: The Set Cult Strikes Back, Larel's Stuff, and the Hall of Shrines

Date: 
Mitrasday, 19th of Gerakios, 2993 AE 


Weather: 

Hot, dry


Player Characters: 

Roskelly Winterleaf, halfling Toll Collector
Several halfling Assistant Toll Collectors
2 Ibis-headed guardians of Thoth
Several Knights of the Azure Shield


We resumed the battle with the Right for Riches company having chased the retreating Settites down the Sighing Stair into the Forum of Set.  At that point the party paused, because there was a portcullis on their left side and they were worried about being surrounded if they continued.  The Settites also paused at the bottom of the stairs, to form up and load crossbows.


Start of the battle


After aiming for a bit, the Settites loosed a volley of crossbow bolts.  Vallium was missed due to his Amulet of Missile Shield.  Vael was behind a wall to the west and out of line of sight, so didn't receive any shots.  Ioannes, Michael, and Uvash each dodged, blocked, or were missed by a couple of bolts.  The Settites dropped their crossbows and readied their melee weapons as they surged forward.

Meanwhile the Settites behind the portcullis to the east rang an alarm gong to summon more guards.  Not wanting to deal with assault from that direction, Vael cast Smoke on those guards, distracting them and wrecking their line of sight.  The one with the gong kept ringing it though.


Vael casts Smoke onto the Set Guildsmen to the east

Uvash used his Divine Grace, which gave him +7 to DX for 13 turns.  With only a short period with Super Dwarf available, the PCs surged forward to meet the mass of Settites at the bottom of the stairs.  Michael readied an Alchemist Fire potion and threw it at one of the Settites.  He missed, but there were so many that it landed in another Settite's hex behind the target, doing some splash damage.

The Right of Riches Company had their shields, while most of the Settite guards had dropped theirs to fire crossbows and had not had a chance to pick them back up, so the PCs were at an advantage.  They cut down a few guards, killing a couple and knocking a couple of others unconcious, but a bunch more approached from the south and southeast.  When things started getting a bit lopsided, Vael threw a Smoke south of the stairs to slow the reinforcements, but the Settites started coming up the stairs and flanked Michael.


The Smoke slows further reinforcements, but there are enough to surround Michael, as the other PCs start falling back.

While surrounded by several Settites, Michael fell down, and appeared doomed.  He managed to regain his feet, but was reeling from his wounds, so his Move and Dodge were reduced.  He was a bit far for Uvash or Ioannes to heal him.  As he tried running up the stairs toward his comrades, one of the Settite guards appeared to hit him cleanly in the back for serious damage -- but Michael's Bless spell averted the attack.  Vael dropped a Grease on the stairs, while caused many of the Settites to fall and others to move more slowly, while Michael's Ring of Free Action let him keep going.  Eventually Michael got close enough to Uvash and Ioannes that they were able to drop a Stop Bleeding and a Major Healing on him, healing him enough to get his full Move back.  At that point Michael was as fast as the Settites, and the other PCs were faster, so they were able to escape up the stairs, with a swarm of Settites in tow.

The Right for Riches Company made it to the top of the Sighing Stair, ran east through the Temple of Set, then south and east past the barricade, then north into the desecrated Temple of Thoth, then down the skinny secret passage to the east.  The faster PCs ran at full speed to buy themselves a few seconds.  Ioannes and Uvash both cast Lend Energy on Vael, who was ready to cast Magelock on the door as soon as Michael came through it.

Unfortunately, right as the lead PCs came out the secret door, Roskelly and several of his halfling toll collector thugs were standing right in that area, looking at the statue.  They immediately started talking about tolls and dungeoneering licenses and asking where the PCs came from, since they hadn't come down the stairs from the Pyramid of Thoth.  Vael pulled out his Dungeoneering License pin and flashed it at Roskelly and said they were a little busy with pursuing Settites right now.  That caused the halflings to take a few steps back toward their territory.  Michael came running through the door, Vallium slammed it closed, and Vael cast Magelock on it.  As they heard the Settites start trying to break the door down, the PCs discussed whether to go north toward the stairs up to the basement, or south to the pyramid teleporter to the Well of Light.  They went toward the basement, and the halflings let them go.

Having not found significant loot or explored much new territory, the Right for Riches company decided to keep delving rather than heading back to towh.  Rather than going upstairs to the basement, they headed east to the bridge over the chasm, and back into the room with the baboon-headed Thoth statue.  Vallium dug through his notes looking for the statue arm settings that opened a door last time, while Vael tried Lockmaster on a locked door to the north.  The spell unexpectedly failed, but a second attempt was a critical success and unlocked the door.  After listening at the door, Vallium went north into a room with 3 sarcophagi.  He motioned the others to stay back, indicating that if there were any arrow traps he didn't want anyone getting hit.  He then pulled the lid off the nearest sarcophagus.  He got a glimpse at a (non-moving) mummy, as tons of sand started pouring out of the ceiling.  Vael and Ioannes, who had been just inside the room, hopped out.  Vallium ran for the exit, which took him about three seconds, through rapidly rising sand, but he made it without falling.  As they looked into the room from the corridor outside they saw that it was buried under many tons of sand.  Vael said they could come back another time with digging tools and digging spells, but for now they should try another way.

They went back into the room with the statue and manipulated its arms to a few different positions.  Two positions each caused a secret door to open and an ibis-headed Guardian of Thoth to emerge to attack them, but the fights were five on one and the Guardians were not that hard to defeat.  A third position caused a door leading east to unlock, and the group went down a passage.

They went past a room to the north with previously looted sarcophagi, then past a large room where Vael had previously defeated a statue by Levitating out of reach, then past a Continually Lit room with a fountain that had given Uvash donkey ears, before finding a new room to the north.  The room had frescoes on all the walls featuring the exploits of the Archontean folk hero Larel One-Eye, who both Vallium and Ioannes recognized.  There were also a cloak rack with several cloaks; a chest; a weapons rack with a variety of knives; a desk with a golden apple, a silver letter opener, and some letters; and a pedestal with a funerary urn on it.  Vael and Ioannes went around the room looking for magic, and found that several of the knives and a couple of the cloaks looked magical, as did the apple.  Vallium checked to see if any of the items looked like the ones on the walls, and a multi-colored cloak looked like Larel's cloak, while one of the knives looked like Larel's stiletto.  Ioannes thought the multi-colored cloak might be magical, while Vael was pretty sure it wasn't, but Vallium put it on and turned invisible.  That settled the debate.  Vael declared that something in the room was interfering with magic detection, and they should take everything.  The letters on the desk all claimed to be from Larel to three different women, and all used the exact same phrasing with only the name changed.  Vael Apportated the chest open and found some clothing; inside a stocking cap Ioannes found a sack.  He reached into the sack and pulled out a rock, and decided the sack was special.  The urn did not appear magical, and the party left that behind.  They searched under the desk and along all the walls, then continued east.

There were doors north and east.  Behind the north door were spiral stairs up.  Vallium decided to go up.  This led them to an area they'd found before, northeast of the Well of Light.  There they remembered a secret door that they had found (with magical assistance after performing the Litany of Light) but never opened.  Vael figured out how to open it, and they opened it to reveal stairs up, with Thothian frescoes.

At the top of the stairs was a a large and interesting room.  There were two rows of statues of Archontean heroes of the past, with a few of the statues missing.  There were also several old corpses in the room.  Iaonnes inspected the bodies and thought they had been violently killed by something strong.  The bodies contained some weapons and armor, a few coins, a couple of potions, and a scroll.  Vael looked everything over and detected a magic sling and a magic shield.  The group then started looking around the edges of the room.  There were eight shrines, but seven of them were closed off behind some kind of magical force fields.  The one that was open contained a book and a quill and some Mithric writing.  Everyone decided to leave the shrine alone for now and come back later.  There was also a large statue of Thoth in ibis-headed form, with some orange gas descending from its beak, and some Mithric writing about pneuma.  Vael said that he had some theories about the statue and the shrine but they should leave for now and come back later.

They went back down to the Well of Light level, then went west and south to the actual Well of Light without encountering any baboons, and Vael cast Flight on Vallium and Michael and Levitation on himself, and everyone flew up the Well, with Vallium and Michael carrying Ioannes and Uvash.  They walked south across the ruins of Arden Vul, climbed down the Cliff Face (with Ioannes using his Luck to avoid a careless fall) and hiked back to Gosterwick.  They met another patrol of Knights of the Azure Shield on the Imperial Road before reaching town, but the Knights just asked them for news of the Settites and let them pass.

For security, Vallium, Uvash, and Michael moved out of the Yellow Cloak Inn and moved into the Arcane Practitioners Club with Vael and Ioannes.  They resolved to treat Gosterwick as a dangerous place after Susarra's murder and try to watch each other's backs.  Vael started analyzing all the items they recovered, casting Analyze Magic multiple times per item in case the magic concealing effect interfered with it.  It appeared that Larel's Cloak, Larel's Sack, and Larel's Pin (the letter opener) were quite powerful items.

GM's Comments:

Superior numbers are good.  The Right for Riches Company appear to be better than Settites, but not better than dozens and dozens of Settites.

I was pretty sure Michael was toast when he was significantly separated from the rest of the party with a whole lot of Settites in between, but Bless and heavy armor and some lucky die rolls and Grease and the Ring of Free Action, plus some timely healing spells, saved him.

I thought it would be hilarious if the PCs took all of Larel's decoy items and missed the concealed good ones, but Ioannes rolled a critical success on a Per+Magery roll, and Vallium thought to correlate the items in the frescoes with the items in the room, and Vael then declared they should take everything in the room even if they didn't think it was magical (except the urn), so that didn't happen.

I think the players were more excited to find a new stairway up than they were to find unguarded magic items.

Achievements:
1 XP for reaching the Forum of Set, an Arden Vul Iconic Location

XP:
1 XP for exploration, for finding 10 new locations
1-2 XP for loot, depending on how much they sell
1 XP for an achievement 
3-4 XP total

Next Week:

They have a lot of options.  They can go after the Set Cult again, or deal with the halflings, or try to revisit the goblins, or explore more of the Halls of Thoth east of the chasm, or go back to the Hall of Shrines.  Or a half-dozen other places.  Arden Vul is big.

Ioannes Grammatikos Byzantios, Archontean cleric of Demma (Demented Avenger)
Michael J. Dundee, Thorcin barbarian (Adam)

Wicktrimmer, the leader of the Rarities Factor in Gosterwick, sent a message to the Right for Riches Company that he believed they had found some significant magical items and he wanted to trade for them.  Vael, Vallium, and Ioannes met with him at the Rarities Factor.  Vael was curious how Wicktrimmer knew, and Wicktrimmer said he was a collector of magical items and regularly used magical means to detect any new powerful items in Gosterwick, but did not give details.

After a long negotiation, the Right for Riches Company contacted a local halfling lawyer, Barnaby Goodbarrel, and had him write up papers incorporating them as an officialy chartered company within Gosterwick, then get approval from the Thesmothete of Vetucaster, Eusbia Phokas.  With their Company legally able to own property, they returned to Wicktrimmer to conclude the deal.

He gave them 20000 pieces of silver, free lifetime banking at the Rarities Factor, personal shopping services in Narsileon (for up to five designated items per month, if available and found by his agent there, using their own funds deposited at the Rarities Factor), and any information on their enemies (particularly the Cult of Set) that he learned.  In exchange they would give him the powerful magic stiletto Larel's Pin and right of first refusal on any magical or historical items the company or its members wanted to sell in the future (except for a few items which Lady Alexia specifically claimed).

Wicktrimmer did not have any new information on the Set cult, beyond the contract on their heads that Coinbase had already told them about.  Vallium decided they should revisit the Great Cavern and see if the Settite guard post they had found there connected with the Forum of Set.  Vael's Living Wheelbarrow (invented by Ashe the goblin druid) was ready, so cast Levitation on it and used it to carry Larel's Sack.

Ioannes spent some of his wealth on an even more expensive power item, which enabled him to cast Bless +2 on Vael, Vallium, and Michael, as long as they paid for the power item recharges.  Uvash declined and kept his Bless +1.

The group left for Arden Vul early Tahsday morning (varying their delve day to throw off their enemies).  They first visited Yrtol's ruined watchtower.  Everyone gathered closely around Uvash and his Amulet of Bravery to resist Yrtol's fear effect, and Vael wore Larel's Cloak in hopes it would impress the ghost.  When they opened the trap door into the basement, Yrtol appeared and started talking about killing them and the rest of the Settites who'd sacrificed his Nyema.  Vael said something about killing many Settites themselves, which slowed Yrtol a bit.  Yrtol asked about Michael's red scale armor, and Vael said that it had come off a dead Settite.  At that point Yrtol decided to spare them, this time, but said not to come back until they'd killed 50 more Settites and recovered Nyema's body.  They asked how they would know her, and Yrtol said she'd had a wedding necklace with her name on it, in Mithric, if any of them could read.

Leaving Yrtol, the group headed north to the waterfall, up the Long Stair to the beastman secret door into the Great Cavern.  After going in, Vallium led them north to the statue of The Philosopher, where he put two magical silver eyes into its empty eye sockets to see what would happen.  The silver eyes disappeared but there was no obvious magical effect.  Vael cast Identify Spell and determined that the statue had just cast some kind of Great Healing spell over the area, but since none of them had been injured, it was wasted.

Next, Vallium lead the group east then north through side caverns until they reached the cave with 3 fire mephits and a column of magical fire.  He asked Michael, wearing the Salamander Amulet, to check out the fire and see if it led anywhere interesting.  It did not.  It nicely cleaned his armor, though.  The mephits were a bit grumpy, because they were out of Eye Opener mushrooms.  They asked the group to bring them some.

Next, the group went west across the Great Cavern toward the Set guard station, 25' up the western wall.  Vael cast The Bracteros Effect on Vallium's Continual Light stone so that nobody far away could see it, and the rest put their lights away.  As they got closer, Vael cast Walk on Air on Vallium, Michael, and Uvash, then used Larel's Cloak to turn himself invisible, then used the Ring of Friendly Defense to turn himself blind and make Vallium invisible.  Invisible Vallium then walked up the air to the Set guard post, where four Set guards were standing.  He backstabbed one of them from total surprise, badly wounding and stunning him.  The stunned guard fell off the tower and sustained near-fatal falling damage.  While the three remaining guards were still a bit surprised, Vallium started stabbing them, while both Michael and Uvash ran up and joined in.  The battle was quickly over, with 3 guards killed and the first one lying unconscious below the tower.  Vael rested to recover from all that spellcasting, while a couple of the others stood guard in case there were more Settites, and a couple killed the unconscious guard, stripped all the guards' weapons and armor, and threw them all in Larel's Sack.  They also found a couple of keys.

They went west into the cliff face, found the Settites' supply room full of sacks of food, and considered burning it but decided not to.  They then continued into the Settites guard rest room, which was unoccupied.  There was a locked door on the north wall, which one of the keys they just took opened.  This led north through a mix of finished passages and rough cave tunnels to another locked door, which led to a finished room with another locked door to the west, which led to stairs down.  This was what they'd been looking for, but they decided to explore more of the immediate area before trying the stairs.

They continued north and found a room full of zombies with axes and shields.  The zombies immediately attacked, through a narrow connecting tunnel.  A slow combat ensued, where the zombies failed to hurt the PCs, but dodged a lot of attacks.  Vael cast a Create Fire in the middle of the zombie swarm, and the zombies mostly just ignored it and slowly burned.  The combination of fire, two swords, and a mace eventually finished all the zombies.  There was a creepy magic black light in the room behind the zombies.  After a bit of examination, Vael smashed it.

Continuing north into another cave, the group saw a 3' tall magical statuette of a sitting golden cat with black gem eyes, surrounded by old corpses of 3 people and a lizard.  Ioannes looked at the corpses but failed to determine cause of death.  Vael started casting Analyze Magic on the statue, but then started hearing meows and hisses in his head.  A few minutes later, he started hearing an accented voice in his head, saying "Avenge this wrong!  Return me to my sister-people.  Touching is forbidden!" over and over.  He tried asking questions, but didn't get any answers.  Uvash and Ioannes thought the statue might be an icon of the Cat Goddess Bastet, but nobody knew of any nearby temples or worshippers of Bastet, so they decided to leave the statue.

To the southwest there was a passage with some kind of flickery force field at the end of it.  Vael tried throwing a rock at it, and it flickered harder.  Michael then attacked it with his sword, and the field failed and fizzled out.  The party went southwest into the room, then a few seconds later a large black pudding hidden on the ceiling dropped onto Ioannes and achieved surprise.  It quickly started smothering him.  Ioannes tried cutting his way out with his axe, while Vallium and Uvash tried bashing it from the outside with sword and mace, and Michael tried pulling the pudding off Ioannes.  Vael first tried some fire and then a wall of lightning to damage the pudding.  Ioannes was badly hurt and knocked unconscious, but the Bracers of Force he was wearing provided some full-body protection, and the combination of stabs and bashes and fire and lightning killed the pudding, as Michael pulled Ioannes out.  Uvash healed Ioannes, while Vael used Apportation to get a sample of the pudding into a glass vial.

After a few minutes to recover, the group searched for secret doors, then Vael cast Seek Earth looking for gold, and Seek Magic.  The nearest unknown gold and magic were to the east, so they went that way.  The magic turned out to be a cave full of some kind of shimmering opalescent fog.  Nobody was sure what it was, and nobody wanted to go into it, so they left that cave.  The gold seemed to be in the direction of a cave full of mushrooms and fungal foresters that they'd visited before.

As they reached mushroom cave, the fungal foresters started speaking a language that nobody recognized.  Ioannes cast Gift of Tongues on Vael to let him speak fungal forester.  The lead forester talked about how cool Ptarmis was and how much he liked the living wheelbarrow and asked if they were friends of Ptarmis.  Vael indicated that they were also friends of Ptarmis and asked if the foresters had a source of cloud cap mushrooms.  The forester indicated that cloud caps were in short supply because the beastmen kept taking them, but might trade some for that wheelbarrow.  Vael said not today, but maybe next time.  He also cast Seek Earth again and found the gold was a bit northwest.  Searching the northwest wall for secret doors, they eventually found one, which the fungal foresters were apparently unaware of, as they were pretty excited when it opened.

The group crowded into a room, containing a big bubbling cauldron and 6 very skinny beastman troopers.  Vael again used Larel's Cloak to appear friendly and charismatic.  The beastmen asked if they were new recruits to Androsia and if they had any food.  Vael lied and said they were, and a couple of them gave their rations to the hungry beastmen.  At that point Vallium led the beastmen to the western part of the room and asked a lot of questions about marching and guarding and Androsia and the area, while Vael turned invisible and started looting the cave.  He found a magic bag, some gold solidi and ancient silver coins, some magic glass eyes on the wall, and a couple of potions on a shelf.  He threw the magic bag into the wheelbarrow and the rest of the stuff into Larel's Sack, then went back out the secret door.  After Vael left, Vallium said something about forgetting something to the southeast before they could return to take their guard shift, and the group left.  The fungal foresters were sniffing around the secret door, so Ioannes cast Gift of Tongues on Vael again, so he could explain that there were beastmen on the other side of the secret door who might be hungry and not friendly, so the foresters might want to keep it closed.

Leaving the fungus cave, the group went north a bit to try to finish their map, and found a room with several goblin-sized cave lizards.  Not looking for a fight, the group backed away.  At that point they went back south and west and decided to try the stairs down.  Vael used Larel's Clock to turn invisible, and the Bracteros Effect to hide his light, and went ahead of the group a bit to scout.  The stairs went down and west quite a bit, then the passage turned south.  To the south was an octagonal room with four exits, and a group of four varumani armed with mattocks were guarding all four exits in ambush position.  Vael turned around and went back to the group, indicating that there might be a serious fight if they continued.

At that point the Right for Riches company decided that they had their quota of dead Settites and loot for the day, and started heading back for Gosterwick.  Vael did some scouting by Levitation and found what looked like a small old Archontean temple atop one pillar of stone, but didn't get very close.  He saw Ptarmis sitting on his big stone throne, but didn't approach close enough to talk.  He also got another look at the big plateau on the eastern end of the Cavern with a weird metal pillar on top and a cave going down inside, but did not stop to investigate either.

The group made it back to Gosterwick, with another magic bag, a decent pile of gold and silver coins, a vile of black pudding, and the weapons and armor of four more Settite guards.  They had found the stairs down they were looking for.

GM's Comments:

Wicktrimmer really wanted Larel's items.  There was a pretty serious debate among the players as to whether to sell or trade any of them, but "We want Wicktrimmer as a friend and knives aren't great weapons and none of us really uses one" won out over "this is a rare and cool magic item so we should keep it just in case", so they sold Larel's Pin.  Larel's Sack and Larel's Cloak were more immediately and obviously useful, so none of the players considered selling them.  Amusingly, after 23 delves without a magic bag, they found magic bags on consecutive delves.  (Vael identified the new one as a regular Bag of Holding, but actually heavier and with a larger capacity than Larel's Sack.  We'll see if they keep both or sell one.)

The group didn't want to try another frontal assault on the Forum of Set in the direction the cult would expect, so they went looking for a back door instead, and found exactly what they were looking for.  However, they also found four varumani on the other side.  We'll see whether they go that way again, or try something else.

The black pudding got Ioannes to -5 HP, 6 away from a death check.  He still had a Bless spell, so he was guaranteed to make his first death check at -11 HP, but the one at -22 HP was no guarantee, and the pudding could have gotten him there quickly.  Fortunately for the PCs, a five on one numerical advantage is really good.  The pudding was pretty tough, and probably could have killed any one of them with surprise, but four of them combined to kill it pretty quickly.  (Michael didn't help kill it, as he was trying to pull it off Ioannes instead.  Which he managed to do, right as it died.)

Using Larel's Cloak (and some food) to get a friendly reaction from Androsia's beastmen, then turn invisible and loot the room they were guarding, was definitely some Larel-like behavior.

Achievements:

None

XP:
Explored 7 new locations, good for 1 XP
Found enough loot to easily get 1 XP each.  Maybe 2 XP if they sell the magic items.
Total 2-3 XP each

Next Week:

No game the next two weeks; GM on vacation.  We'd played every week since March, so this ends a good streak, but we'll start another one when I get back.

# DFRPG Arden Vul Session 26: The Scouring of the Shire

Lunday, 1st of Besemios, 2993 AE 


Weather: 

Cool, dry


Player Characters: 

Vael Sunshadow, Half-Elven mage (Kyle)
Vallium Halcyon, Archontean fighter (Greybrown)
Ioannes Grammatikos Byzantios, Archontean cleric of Demma (Demented Avenger)
Michael J. Dundee, Thorcin barbarian (Adam)
Lacrymosa, Elf Grudge Brigade mercenary archer (Archon Shiva)


Significant NPCs:

Craastonistorex, green dragon
Briar, Wyvern
Giant Tick

Roskelly Winterleaf, Halfling toll collector and mob lieutenant
Blandveg, Archontean mage, alchemist, and poisoner
Many halfling fighters
Many halfling thieves

The Right for Riches company decided it was finally time to take down Plumthorn's extortionist halfling gang.  But they waited until the Lunday after the Voluptarian Days intercalary period to go back to Arden Vul.  Uvash was unexpectedly ill (some suspected a hangover after the harvest festivals, but that was also unusual for a dwarf), so they hired Lacrymosa the mercenary archer from the Grudge Brigade.

They woke up very early, with the goal of arriving at the base of the Cliff Face beneath the ruins of Arden Vul around dawn.  Vael Levitated himself and a Living Wheelbarrow containing a Bag of Holding up the cliff, while the others roped themselves together for safety and climbed the Long Stair.  As they walked north through the ruins of Arden Vul, a huge green shape flanked by a merely large green shape appeared overhead, then dropped down in front of them into the Forum of Arden Vul.  It was Craastonistorex the green dragon, and he was angry.  He informed them that Someone Had Messed With the Water Level Again, and that as Wardens of the Dam, it was their job to keep that from happening.  He also informed them that they were late with their tribute.  Vael apologized, said they'd fix the dam right away, and that they'd bring tribute next week.  Craastonistorex said that next week wasn't soon enough, and he needed a magic item now or he would eat one of them.  Lacrymosa set down a potion.  Craastonistorex appeared to consider eating her for such a paltry gift, but magnanimously let it slide, as Briar the wyvern picked up the potion in his claws.  The dragon repeated his instruction to fix the water level immediately, and flew away, flanked by his pet.

The group immediately headed for the dam.  They saw their lock was gone from the door.  Inside the dam, all the tools they had been storing were gone.  Vallium immediately used the dam controls to reset the water level to the dragon's preferred setting.  Meanwhile, Vael cast Seeker looking for the wheelbarrow they had kept in the dam, and saw that it was in Newmarket, about 30 miles to the South.  He then cast Trace to prepare to hunt down the thieves, but they realized 30 miles was a long walk and keeping the spell up that long was impractial, and let it lapse.  He finally used Shape Earth to close some of the dam's stonework over the door, so that nobody else could easily go in and manipulate the water level again.

Vallium led the group to the basement entrance southwest of the Pyramid of Thoth.  As they walked through the ruined basement, a giant tick (roughly the size of a large dog) attempted to surprise and eat Lacrymosa.  She saw it coming, didn't deign to waste any arrows on it, and called from help while running away.  Michael, nearby, pulled out his sword and chopped the vermin in half.  The group then continued north through the basement and down the spiral stairs.  Halfway down the spiral stairs to the Halls of Thoth, Vallium tripped over a tripwire, connected to some bells.  He did not fall, but the bells made a lot of noise.  The others stepped over the tripwire, but they were worried that whoever placed the tripwire was now alerted to their presence.

At the bottom of the stairs, Vael cast Keen Vision to reduce the chance of further surprise, and cast Bracteros Effect on his Continual Light rock so that nobody could see it from a distance.  He asked the others to put their lights away, and then moved up to the front next to Vallium to look for trouble.  The group continued south and east until they were near the cavern, then halted to discuss tactics.  After some discussion Vael borrowed Lacrymosa's Lion's Cloak to gain Infravision, cast Wizard Eye, cast Invisibility on it, and sent the invisible Wizard Eye down the chasm to investigate.  The Eye peeked into the first room full of halflings and saw three guards by the chasm and several other halflings within the room.  It continued south and peeked in the second room, spying Plumthorn, Blandveg, and three more guards.  It continued south further and found another chasm exit on the east side of the chasm, then a couple of rooms they had previously found even further south, then winked out of existence as Vael decided not to maintain the spell.

With the Wizard Eye confirming that Plumthorn and Blandveg were there, they finalized the plan.  Vallium would drink a Flight Potion, Vael would cast Flight on Michael and maintain Levitation on himself, Vael would cast Invisibility on all the others and use Larel's Cloak to make himself invisible, and Vallium and Michael would carry Ioannes and Lacrymosa across the chasm.  They would attempt to bypass the first room full of halflings and enter the room with Plumthorn and Blandveg, kill those leaders, and then induce the other halflings to surrender.  While the others discussed the plan, Lacrymosa drank a Strength Potion and an Agility Potion and cast a Concussion spell, holding the small magical stone.

Flying from the chasm into Plumthorn's room
Flying from the Chasm into Plumthorn's room



The group flew invisibly and silently past the first group of halfings, and into the room with the leaders.  Lacrymosa threw the Concussion at the three halfling chasm guards, stunning two of them and knocking the third unconscious.  She then put an arrow into Blandveg's heart, killing him quickly.  Michael dropped her and flew toward Plumthorn, while Vallium dropped Ioannes and flew toward Plumthorn, leading with his shield.  Plumthorn was a bit slow to react, and took a shield to the face from Vallium, knocking him prone, then a hard sword blow, wounding him and causing him to move slowly.

As Michael flew in to help finish off Plumthorn, the halfling leader asked for a parley.  While the negotiations commenced, Lacrymosa brutally put arrows into the eyes of both stunned halflings, killing them.  She they saw two halfling guards behind the portcullis 40 yards to the west charging toward the battle, and shot both of them too, this time going for vitals instead of eyes.  Plumthorn asked a lot of questions, while Vallium asked for unconditional surrender in return for the lives of Plumthorn and his surviving followers.  Roskelly led his followers from the Glory of Thoth through the portcullis.


Shooting West toward the Portcullis



Vael, still invisible, attempted to intimidate Plumthorn by explaining that everyone else in the room was dead and the reinforcements to the west were also dead and any other reinforcements who appeared in the hall would also be dead and he had better surrender soon.  Possibly because of the effects of Larel's Cloak, this was very effective, and Plumthorn gave up and yelled to the others to surrender.  Roskelly decided to run rather than surrendering, and Lacrymosa didn't like that, and shot him many, many times, not stopping even after Roskelly was clearly very dead.  Nobody else ran after that.

Ioannes cast Stop Bleeding on Plumthorn to keep him from bleeding out, and then the group stripped all the halflings of all their armor, metal weapons, and valuables, allowing them to keep their clothes and very cheap weapons like clubs and slings.  Vael instructed Plumthorn to lead his survivors out of Arden Vul, all the way back to Newmarket, and never come back or they would be killed.  The halflings filed up the stairs, leaving behind a giant pile of smelly extra small leather armor, spears, shortswords, and knives.

Vael and Vallium went south to parley with the goblins on the other side of the barricade separating halfling and goblin territory.  They informed the goblins that all the halfling territory would become goblin territory, and to send a messenger to King Weskenim.  The goblin sergeant, Bottleneck, was very excited by this news, and sent one of his warriors running down the tunnel to the Wet Caves.

Vael re-cast Keen Vision and went through all the halfling rooms.  In one sarcophagus, he found a secret compartment that the halflings seemed to have missed, with some treasure inside.  He used one of Plumthorn's keys to open Plumthorn's chest and found some more loot.  He found one wall that looked like new construction, but didn't find any secret doors in it.  Finally, Vael went to the approximate center of the halfling territory and cast Seek Earth for both platinum and gold, and Seek Magic.  All three spells pointed the same way, around 30 yards southeast, which did not correspond to a known room, so they noted that as a place to search for later.

The group then went west into the Glory of Thoth and searched the unexplored rooms that directly connected to it.  One led to a false door that opened a pit trap, but Vael had Levitation on and Vallium was quick enough to grab the edge of the pit as he fell, so nobody was hurt.  Another room was full of trash, and they decided not to spend much time searching it, since the Seek Earth and Seek Magic hadn't found anything there.  A third room contined both a Thothian teleportation circle and a magical bust floating in the air.  The bust could not be moved or taken, and did not respond to conversation, so they left it for now.

As the party finished their searches, the goblin sergeant Bottleneck came back up to the barricade.  He said his messenger had informed Killik, the Big Boss of the Wet Caves, who had gone to see King Weskenim, but they had not heard back from the King yet.  Vael advised that the goblins could take their new territory but should not go west of the Glory of Thoth because there were Settites there.  The group then followed a goblin guide down to the Wet Caves, then down to Goblintown.  The goblin led them over a frail bridge (none of the big people broke through), and over to the Goblin Court.  Killik was there, waiting for King Weskenim to come out of his harem.

A few minutes later, the King emerged from the harem room, spoke to Killik, went into his audience room, spoke to his advisors, then invited the Right for Riches company in.  He informed them that he was very happy that the rightful goblin territory had been restored, and rewarded them with a large perfect diamond.  He also said that he still owed them a reward for freeing his brother Gribble from Set prison, and pointed at a human-sized set of magical scale armor on display.  It was the armor of a huge ancient goblin king, but it was too big for Weskenim, so he was awarding it to them.

At that point Vael started negotiating with the king.  He would happily present the former halfling territory to the goblins, but wanted free passage through goblin territory.  The king agreed, but said that some goblin territory was dangerous so they should get an escort.  Vallium asked about Gislu and the Scepter of the Goblins.  The king said that Gislu was some kind of fake mystic and the Scepter seemed like a ploy to steal power, and it might not exist, but if it did exist, it was the rightful property of the king and he would reward them for finding it.  They also asked about the Regalia that the Green Lady was looking for, but the goblin king didn't know anything about that.  Weskenim also noted that he had a guest room that was currently occupied by a Sun-Scarred Knight, but that if the occupants moved on, the Right for Riches company would be welcome to use it.  In the meantime they would be welcome to visit the Goblin Great Hall for shopping and dining.  Vael also asked about the Troll Lifts, and the king said they were east of the goblin territory in the Wet Caves and Killick could point out the way.  And also that the trolls preferred to be called varumani.

The group asked if they could meet the Knight, so an escort took them to the guest room nearby.  The door was opened by a large angry woman with magical armor and an axe, who didn't appear to want visitors.  She was overruled by her superior, Sir Sorrow, an equally large but less angry woman who invited the company into the guest room.  She was wearing amazingly heavy armor of a type the group had never seen, plates like a giant lobster which looked like they were probably impervious to harm.  A long discussion ensued, about who the Sun-Scarred Knights were, their role in preserving the peace within the Halls, what the elimination of the halflings meant, what the attacks on the Setties could do, the leader of the Knights, where they could get some armor like that, etc.

At the conclusion of the conversation, the company said farewell to Sir Sorrow, and were led by a random goblin guide east then north past Rizzit the imprisoned creepy purple wax demon (who asked to be freed) then down a spiral staircase then into the Goblin Great Hall.  This was a huge cave filled with many goblins, quite a few goats, and probably some other creatures.  There was also a huge bonfire in the middle, which some goblins were using for cooking.  There were several merchants set up behind tables in the southeast corner, so the group went that way for some shopping.

The first merchant was an Archontean woman selling weapons and armor, but nobody saw anything magical, so they kept walking.  The second merchant was an angry Wiskin guy selling food and drink, but nobody was hungry. The third merchant was a halfling named Master Leifcrim selling curios, and a couple of them looked magical, so they stopped to shop.  He ended up selling them another Returning Pebble (and explained that if a proper sales contract was written out, the magic of the pebble somehow knew that it had a new owner and would return to them), another magic fish-shaped rod of unknown use (but probably something to do with boats), and a small non-magical orange oval object made of a strange substance (it felt kind of like insect chitin) with strange glyphs and no known use.  They weren't sure they wanted the orange thing, but Leifcrim hinted that he had some really good magical items for really rich good customers, so they paid full price for the orange thing hoping that would lead to good deals in the future.

At that point, it was time to go back to Gosterwick, so the Right for Riches Company took their wheelbarrow and magical bags full of halfling loot and headed back up the stairs, then up the slope to the Glory of Thoth, then up the stairs to the surface and down the cliff.  They did not see Plumthorn or his followers on the way.
Sure

GM's Comments:

They finally got around to taking out the halflings.  It would have been a hard battle if it had happened months ago.  At this point, with the combination of a good ambush plan, flight and invisibility magic, and Lacrymosa (enhanced to superhuman strength and dexterity with potions and also using a Bless spell) shooting everything that moved, it wasn't very hard at all.  Plumthorn tried to negotiate, from a position of weakness, until Vael's critical success on an Intimidation roll showed him that he would be very dead very soon if he didn't give up immediately.

King Weskenim was happy to be gifted the halfling territory and rewarded them with free passage, loot, information, and an introduction to Sir Sorrow.  Sir Sorrow told them a bit about her order, the Sun-Scarred Knights, and the balance between factions in the Halls.

Achievements:

Quest bonus: 1 XP for eliminating Plumthorn's Halflings
Iconic location bonus: 1 XP for reaching the Court of the Goblin King and the Great Hall of the Goblins

XP:
Exploration: 6 new locations, good for 1 XP
Loot: 2 XP (diamond, whole bunch of halfling stuff)
Achivements: 2 XP
Total: 5 XP

Next Week:

With the halflings eliminated, the Right for Riches company needs to pick a new goal.  Do they explore more of the former halfling territory, explore more of Goblintown proper, go looking for the Troll Lifts, or resume their war against the Cult of Set?  I have no idea.

# DFRPG Arden Vul Session 27: The Tomb of Ptoh-Ristus

Date: 
Mitrasday, 10th of Besemios, 2993 AE 


Weather: 

Cool, dry


Player Characters: 

Vael Sunshadow, Half-Elven mage (Kyle)
Vallium Halcyon, Archontean fighter (Greybrown)
Ioannes Grammatikos Byzantios, Archontean cleric of Demma (Demented Avenger)
Uvash Edzuson, Dwarven cleric of Zodarrim (Cosmo)
Sister Valya "Basilisk" Hushbreaker, Halfling mercenary monk (ArchonShiva)


Significant NPCs:

Vivian, priest of Demma
Wicktrimmer, Imperial Goblin banker and trader
Sanguinette, Basilisk's bat familiar
8 Set cultists
Bottleneck, goblin sergeant
Lots and lots of goblins
4 huge spiders
2 animated spearman constructs
2 mummies


Uvash, Vael, and Ioannes were all very sick.  Ioannes had no idea what it was but suspected something magical, so they went to the Temple of Demma, where the head priest Vivian diagnosed them with a magical curse and cast a Remove Curse spell on each of them, in exchange for a suitable donation to feed the poor.  They were never quite sure where the curse came from, but the spell seemed to fix it.  They grumbled about the cost anyway.

Vael went to visit Wicktrimmer at the Rarities Factor, found out that there was no news on their shopping list in Narsileon, and discussed whether Wicktrimmer would be willing to take over running the Forum of Set if the Right for Riches company successfully destroyed the Settites.  Wicktrimmer was non-committal.

Trying to keep their delve dates and times unpredictable, the Right for Riches company left at midnight on Demmasday.  Uvash wasn't happy about having to get up in the middle of the night.  The lights were shining in the entrance to the Set level, so Vael turned invisible and Levitated up to spy on the Settites, with Basilisk climbing the wall nearby and Basilisk's bat familiar Sanguinette flying beside.  The Settites charged with raising and lowering the basket were out of sight from outside.  Then some red-robed Set cultists started waving lanterns and torches below, and the Settites at the top lowered the basket and hoisted 4 of them up.  After a brief whispered discussion with Vael, Basilisk cut the rope, and the basket and its four cultists fell a very long way and smashed into the ground below.  The remaining cultists who had been waiting for their turn in the basket ran away, but the Right for Riches company chased them down and killed them.

With their daily quota of Settites eliminated, the PCs crossed over the Swift River at the northern bridge, then climbed up the Long Stair toward the ruins of Arden Vul.  They left a Hand of Glory (an evil Settite magic item they didn't think they could safely use) on top of the dam as tribute to Craas the green dragon, then headed for the Pyramid of Thoth.  They manipulated the statue arms to open the trap door to the safer set of stairs down, and went down into the pyramid.  At the first large landing below they met a guard party of goblins, who said this was now goblin territory.  Vael said something about how they were the Right for Riches company and were allowed, and the goblin sergeant checked his notes and said they were indeed expected and should check in with Master Sergeant Bottleneck near the Glory of Weskenim.

When they reached the bottom of the stairs, there was a closed door with a little window in it, and a goblin guard watching through the window.  After they announced themselves, the guard went to get Bottleneck, who let them in.  He seemed happy to see them, and gave Vael, Vallium, and Ioannes similar embroidered patches featuring a goblin impaling a halfling, commemorating the liberation of Upper Goblintown from the evil halflings.  (Uvash and Basilisk didn't get patches.)  Bottleneck pointed around the new goblin territory, warned the PCs about a couple of pit traps and the dangers of wandering zombies and Settites to the west, and said they were welcome to visit anytime.  He asked them to tell any other surface dwellers who wanted to visit the new goblin territory to bring booze.

Vael suggested a slight detour to the southwest to the small inside pyramid, because Vael wanted to cast Seeker to see if he could find the teleport control lever for the other pyramid on the Well of Light level, and figured that doing so while looking at an identical lever would improve his odds.  Sure enough, he got a vision of a lever sitting at the bottom of a wet pit, next to some kind of slimy monster, in the room with the Ruby Chair.  The group briefly discussed going after that lever, but decided that finding treasure in the new goblin territory was more urgent, in case the goblins found it first.

They went east, through the gray smelly mist, past the disgusting pool that the goblin guards called their new swimming pool, through a couple of secret passages, and into a room full of pillars.  They went east to where there were two adjacent doors that both led to known traps.  They opened the eastern door, which they knew led to a pit trap.  Vallium spiked it open, worried about self-closing doors.  They avoided the known pit trap, went to the end of the hall, tried to open a false door, and opened the known pit plus three previously unknown ones.  They were somewhat prepared for this, with Vallium secured to Uvash by a rope and Vael Levitating, so nobody actually fell in.  After verifying that none of the pits had anything useful inside and that the door was actually false, they went back out.

From there Vallium led them east toward the room of Prior Jacobus, which he said they'd never searched for treasure since helping Jacobus's ghost to his final rest.  Sure enough, when they found the room they found some very small orange Thothian robes, a key, a ring, and a couple of maps.  Vallium led the others through the rest of Jacobus's area, but they didn't find any other treasure.

Vael then cast Walk on Air on everyone, and everyone flew back across the Great Chasm to the west and searched the rooms there.  They found a magic stone chair again, but didn't sit in it.  They found a porch overlooking the chasm, with some abandoned rope and spikes.  There were also some stairs down, which they didn't take, but while they were searching the area, some huge spiders dropped from above and tried to eat Vallium.  Unfortunately for the spiders, his scale armor was stronger than their teeth, and he quickly recovered from surprise and killed all of them.

Going south from the porch, Ioannes found a secret door, and Vallium went through it and fell in a pit trap.  It hurt a bit, but his armor cushioned the fall.  The pit was full of a bunch of corpses and their equipment, so Vallium started looting, and Vael flew in to help identify the treasure.  The pit closed over their head before they were done, but they yelled up to have the others re-open it, then came out.

Continuing west, they found another secret door, leading them back to the giant stone chair overlooking the Chasm that Ioannes had previously sat in.  This time they avoided the chair and Vael cast more Walk on Air spells to help everyone fly up the chasm.  The spotted a room on the far side with another, much bigger stone chair.  That room had a large stela on the floor, featuring a carving of some kind of large biped with horns, surrounded by some glyphs in a totally unknown language.  Vael thought the language looked similar to the one on the orange oval object he had purchased in the goblin market.  They decided not to explore that room or its exits and went back to the Chasm.

Continuing north and west up the Chasm, they spotted a narrow passage heading east that Vael's Wizard Eye had spotted last week, but didn't follow it.  They then found a secret door on the west wall, in the area where they were hoping for treasure based on Seek Earth and Seek Magic castings.  Everyone went into the short secret passage, and Ioannes found a second secret door, into a room with treasure piled on the floor.  Vael opened it, and a needle trap failed to poke through his armor.  There was a big chest full of ancient coins, a matched pair of magic rugs, a bunch of alabaster vases and a silver ibis and a golden feather, a cleric scroll with a previously unknown and powerful spell to raise the sanctity level of an area, and a book in an unknown language.  They shoveled all the treasure into their magic bags.

A dead end passage south looked like an obvious place for another secret door, but there was no obvious way to open it.  Everyone looked, and then Vael tried a Lockmaster spell, but nothing worked.  Uvash suggested a pickaxe, but that seemed like too much effort so Vael used a Shape Earth spell.  That opened a hole into a larger room, containing two normal-sized white marble sargophagi and a huge black basalt sarcophagus.  There were also a couple of man-sized statues of spearmen.  When Vallium went into the room, the statues animated and charged.

A short fight ensued, where Vallium stabbed the statues while Basilisk glided down from the ceiling while attempting to stun them with kiai yells.  Once both constructs were smashed, the group continued into the room to look at the large sarcophagus.  It had a Mithric inscription saying “Ptoh-Ristus, Servant of the Lord Thoth, Knower of Secrets and Founder of these Halls”.  Vallium removed the lid, at which point the lids of the other two sarcophagi popped off and two mummies came out.

There were then two somewhat separate fights, with Vallium and Vael fighting the southern mummy and Uvash and Ioannes fighting the northern one, with Basilisk gliding around and yelling kiai at whichever one was closer.  One of the mummies hit Uvash pretty hard once, then knocked his Bless spell off with another punch.  Vael cast Great Haste on Vallium, who finished off one mummy then ran across the room to help with the other one.  Eventually Vallium downed it, while Uvash and Ioannes cautiously defended themselves.

The large sarcophagus contained another mummy, this one inert, with a magical golden death mask.  It also held some coins and some doll-sized furniture, including a tiny magic chair.  The group took everything that looked valuable, but Vael was suspicious they might be missing something, so used a charge from the Wand of See Secrets.  This didn't find any more treasure, but it showed a secret door in the southeast of the room, a huge falling stone block trap inside the secret door, and a bunch of poison dart traps along two walls.  Vael avoided touching any of the trapped areas and used magic to open the secret door, then Levitated down the secret passage to finish mapping the area.  It led back to an area he already knew, so he returned to the group.

With a decent amount of treasure found and everyone feeling tired, the group rested a bit, then Vael cast Walk on Air on everyone again.  They continued north up the Chasm until they reached a goblin-occupied room, where they greeted the goblin guards then walked over to the Glory of Thoth and up the stairs to the Pyramid of Thoth.  They then headed back to Gosterwick.

GM's Comments:

The players knew (due to knowledge magic) there was gold, platinum, and magic in the area southeast of the former halfling territory, but not exactly where, but they did a pretty good job of staying on target and using their map to search for secret doors until they found it.  They actually found the "back door" from the chasm to the Tomb; the "front door" that they didn't find until the end was actually much more dangerous as it had the worst traps, including the 10'x10'x10' stone block of "if this lands on you, you are just dead.  We don't need to roll the damage."

Two of the magic items they found in the tomb were very interesting.  The pair of magic rugs were Rugs of Instant Access, which allow teleportation from one to the other.  This seemed very useful, but they weren't sure about the exact limits yet.  The Death Mask of Ptoh-Ristus had a bunch of useful powers (Infravision, See Secrets, Will bonus, bonus to detect lies and illusions), but also some remaining magic that appeared very difficult to identify, as Vael and Lyssanra and Pelteon all failed.  We'll see if the Right for Riches company sells these items or keeps them for use.

Achievements:

None

XP:
Exploration: 6 new locations, good for 1 XP
Loot: Looks like 1 XP if they don't sell the good magic items, 2 XP if they do
Achievements: 0 XP
Total:  Probably 2 XP

The Plan:

Vallium's plan for the week was to trade with the cave people to the west of the waterfall below Arden Vul, see if the Rugs of Instant Access had enough range to bypass climbing the Long Stair, clear out the pits near the Ruby Chair and find the control rod for the indoor pyramid teleporter, test the indoor pyramid teleporter, perform the Litany of Light again, talk to Yamki and Stamelis, donate a lot of alcohol to the goblins, and explore more of the Well of Light or Halls of Thoth levels.

What Actually Happened:

Vael got a tip from Creon the pawnbroker than an interesting item was available, and it turned out to be the Eyes of Set, some goggles that allegedly allowed seeing through magical darkness cast by Settites.  Vael purchased them.

Vallium went to Theopilos to have copies of Plumthorn's keys made for the goblins.  He also went to Egill at the Baliff's Truncheon tavern and purchased several barrels of moonshine for the goblins.  He also bought several axes for trade with the cave people.

Wicktrimmer sent the Right for Riches Company a note that he had information about their shopping list.  Vallium, Vael, and Uvash showed up at the Rarities Factor, where Wicktrimmer told them that his agents in Narsileon had found a magic broadsword that Vallium might like and some magic scale armor that might meet Michael's requirements, but that neither Bracers of Force nor any giant spider silk had been found.  Vallium and Vael (speaking for Michael, who was off in the woods somewhere on another hunting trip) approved the purchases, which Wicktrimmer said should arrive via mule train in a few weeks.

Wicktrimmer then said that His Sources had revealed the presence of strong teleportation magic in Gosterwick, and asked if they knew anything about that.  Vael admitted the existence of the teleportation rugs but said they hadn't told Wicktrimmer because they were still testing how well they worked.  Wicktrimmer asked for a description of the rugs, and said they sounded like Rugs of Instant Access, which Sligo the Devious famously used to assassinate Leonidas of Archontos.  He asked for an update after the rugs were tested, and said that if they had enough range to teleport someone from Gosterwick to Narsileon, he would pay a whole lot of money for them.

Trying to avoid being predictable, someone rolled a 7-sided die to figure out the day of their next delve.  It came up Tahsday, so very early Tahsday morning they set out for the caves west of the Swift River.  There were several cavemen standing guard outside their cave, They called into the cave for reinforcements, and a couple dozen more people came out.  Nobody shared a common language or had language magic, but Vallium gestured a desire to trade, and pulled 5 good quality metal axes out of Larel's Sack.  The cave people were impressed by the axes, and their older female leader (who turned out to be named Grugga) sent someone back into the cave to get something.  A few minutes later he emerged carrying a metal axe head, and being yelled at by a women who apparently didn't want him to trade the axe head.  Vael saw that the axe head was magical, and so told Vallium that trading 5 whole axes for that one axe head was a good deal.  The trade was made, and then the Right for Riches company tried gesturing back and forth with the cave people for a while but gained no significant information (beyond the gestured version of "snake people basket fall down go boom", which they already knew because they had been the ones to make the basket fall down), before leaving.

They walked a bit into the woods and spread out one Rug of Instant Access across the ground, then Vael cast Levitation and flew to the top of the cliff, holding the other Rug.  Vael spread out his Rug across the ground at the top, then stepped on it and said the command word "viator", and appeared on the other Rug near the others.  The others then used the lower Rug to teleport to the upper Rug, one at a time.  Finally Vael grabbed the lower Rug and flew up to the top of the cliff with the others.  The total time for two flights up the cliff was about six minutes, compared to well over an hour to climb the Long Stair (depending on climbing skill, load carried, and risks taken), so everyone agreed this was a success.

The group walked north through the ruins of Arden Vul to the top of the Well of Light.  Vael dropped a Continual Light rock down the Well and didn't see a bright reflection at the bottom, which indicated that the bottom mirror had probably been covered.  He Levitated down the shaft carrying one Rug, saw that the fixed mirror was indeed covered in muck and the portable mirror and stand were gone, but didn't see anything dangerous in the area.  He landed, spread out the Rug, teleported through it, sent the other 3 through the top Rug, then grabbed the top Rug and flew down the Well again to rejoin the others.  They spent several minutes cleaning baboon feces off the fixed mirror, then went south to visit the head of Stamelis in the Library of Thoth.

Stamelis seemed happy to see them, but didn't have a lot of news.  Nothing had come into the locked Library, though he had heard some baboons hooting.  He was annoyed that he had a whole library of books to read but no ability to fetch books or turn pages, and requested that the group find a nice priest of Thoth to assist him.

Everyone headed north to the Hall of Judgment.  They pushed studs on the Ruby Chair until both pits opened.  One still contained 2 crocodiles, though they weren't moving much, possibly due to hunger.  The other contained some kind of creature with tentacles, and that was the pit that Vael's Seeker spell had said the pyramid control lever was in.  The tentacles weren't long enough to reach the top of the pit, so Vael decided to un-sportingly use Wall of Lightning in the water-filled pit to electrocute the monster from afar.  This worked, and after a while the whole room smelled of an unholy combination of wet dog and burned fish.  Vael rested for a while, then Vallium tied a long rope around the punishment pillar, and Vael levitated down into the pit while Uvash climbed down the rope to guard him.  Vael spotted the control rod for the pyramid and a magic wand and grabbed both.

The group discussed whether they should also kill the crocodiles, and then thought there might be treasure in that pit too, so they had to.  Vael repeated the remote electrocution trick.  This time Vallium went into the pit with Vael, because he wanted to try using his survival skills to try to extract valuable crocodile skin, and also see if there was anything valuable in their stomachs.  He failed to skin them cleanly, destroying the hides.  He also didn't find anything valuable inside them.  He did, however, make a giant stinky mess.  Meanwhile Vallium picked up a few silver coins.  The missing mirror was also in the pit, along with its stand, which was broken into two parts but looked fixable.  Vallium loaded the heavy mirror into the Living Wheelbarrow and Levitated it up.

With both pits cleared, the group turned their attention to the Ruby Chair.  Both dwarves agreed it sure looked like it was carved from one giant hunk of ruby, but that was impossible as rubies didn't get that big.  Vael cast Seek Earth for ruby, and it pointed right at the chair.  Thronebreaker tried using his considerable strength to move the chair, but it didn't move.  There was a Mithric inscription behind the chair that said “Speak the Secret Name and Claim Thy Reward.”  Vael read the inscription out loud, which did nothing.  He didn't know any secret name, but they thought Stemelis might, so they went back to the library to talk to him.  Stamelis didn't tell them any secret names.  Vael started looking through the books hoping one would have the secret name, but most of the books in the Thoth section were written in the Secret Language of Thoth, which Stamelis would not teach him because Thoth's Secrets Are For Thoth's Children.  After various attempts to trick, fast-talk, or persuade Stamelis, they left again.

Wanting to test the pyramid control rod, the Right for Riches company went west to the indoor pyramid, where Vallium installed the rod.  They then flipped the rod and appeared on top of the nearly identical pyramid one level down.  They they moved the matching rod there, and were back on the Well of Light level.

The group headed east toward the Howling Caves, and found Yamki the Three-Armed in a room just north of the portcullis leading to the Caves.  At that point there were some pointed questions about how the mirror got re-pooped.  Yamki said he didn't do it and his loyal baboons didn't do it but there might be some renegade baboons who didn't respect his authority and management was hard.  Vallium offered Yamki a bunch of meat in exchange for leaving the mirror alone and telling them who had vandalized it.  Yamki wasn't sure exactly who, but said that Trefko the old four-armed baboon, and several female baboons who had formerly been Sisko's harem, were still living to the west of the Hall of Judgment, and didn't listen to him.  The group headed that way to talk to the other baboons.

They went north past the Ruby Chair, the west past a trap door up with a rope hanging out of it, which they had seen before but hadn't explored.  They declined to explore it again and went south.  Eventually they listened at a door and heard loud snores behind it.  Opening the door found Trefko stumbling to his feet.  Trefko said that he hadn't been the one pooping on the mirror, but he didn't want to live in the Howling Caves because there were too many young baboons there and they were too loud.  He would stay in his room.  He agreed to not cause any trouble with the mirrors, in exchange for meat.  He also wanted a contract that said he was in charge of all the baboons, but Vallium said that was impractical and they had to work that out among themselves.  Uvash and Thronebreaker noticed that Trefko was wearing a Dwarven Life Stone around his neck, and asked whether he'd be willing to trade it.  He said that might be possible, for gems or large quantities of meat.  Vallium said they'd bring him a whole live goat next time.

Heading south, the group found the room with Sisko's former harem, which consisted of 4 baboons and 2 goblins.  They had a human male prisoner manacled to the ceiling.  These baboons couldn't talk, but the goblins could, and said they considered themselves part of the baboon tribe and didn't need rescuing, and also that King Weskenim sucked.  Also that Sisko was the king of the baboon tribe, so with his death they were the reigning queens, and they could poop wherever they wanted as this was their territory.  Vael went with diplomacy trying to talk sense into them to avoid violence, while Thronebreaker went with intimidation and ripped the prisoner's chains apart.  With the harem somewhat cowed by this display of brute force, Vallium told them that they had given Yamki a bunch of food to avoid further vandalism of the mirror, and that if the harem wanted some of it they should go over there to get it.  Once they left, Uvash healed the prisoner, a Thorcin warrior named Burris.  Vael levitated up to search two sacks hanging from the ceiling, and it turned out one was full of coins and the other full of miscellaneous treasure.  All of that went into the Bag of Holding.  Someone felt a bit bad for taking all the stuff, and suggested leaving some of the booze that was intended for the goblins in exchange.

Vael searched for secret doors, and found one on the east wall.  It was very hard to figure out how to open it, but a critical success on a Lockmaster spell did it.  Beyond the secret door was a narrow cobwebby corridor that looked like it had been unused for centuries.  Everyone explored it and found a tunnel heading east and a suspicious dead end to the north.  The dead end found another secret door, near the Ruby Chair, so once they opened that one to confirm they had a safe exit, they closed the first one so the harem wouldn't know about the secret passage.  Everyone then took the tunnel east.  Thronebreaker lent Burris an axe, just in case.

The tunnel led to a rough cavern, with an old corpse and some ancient rotted food.  There were dead end passages northeast and southeast.  The one northeast led to a secret door, which Thronebreaker opened.  That led to a room with a sarcophagus, but before anyone could explore it, three mantari (small flying ray-shaped creatures with stingers) ambushed Thronebreaker.  One of them actually hit and slightly wounded him, and then he and Vallium killed one and scared the other two into flying away.  The sarcophagus was empty, but there was a bridge over the Great Chasm (which was pretty narrow here) further east.

Crossing the bridge led to a room with a bunch of funerary gisants and some rotted crates.  After a bit of poking around, a ghost appeared and did not attack.  She revealed that she was Ptirasa, a priestess of Thoth, and warned the others that Arpostas was a traitor.  They had no idea who Arpostas was, though.  She also revealed that there were some nasty bugs in the crates and they should stay away from them.  Vael used Create Fire to keep the bugs away, and then the group found a secret door to the east, leading to a north-south passage they'd found before.

With exploration to the east complete, they doubled back to the west and explored more secret passages.  They eventually found a room with a pile of baboon skeletons on the floor, along with one human skeleton with an apparently magical axe, and a female elf skeleton on a bed.  Someone tried to take the axe, and the human skeleton predictably stood up and fought them.  However, it was four on one, and when the skeleton turned to face Vallium, Thronebreaker got behind it and did a Power Blow plus Rapid Strike from behind.  The skeleton managed to avoid one of the blows, but the other hit it hard enough to shatter its brittle bones.

With the skeleton no longer a threay, Vael started searching the room for magic, and they grabbed the magic axe and nonmagical mail and shield from the human skeleton, plus a magic pouch, a single magic gauntlet, a couple of magic arrows, and a spellbook from the elf skeleton.  There was a stone chest under the bed, but it was empty.  Nobody wanted to believe that, so an intensive search ensued.  When that didn't find anything, the whole stone chest went into the Bag of Holding for further investigation.

With little time left in the session, Vallium still hadn't delivered the booze to the goblins.  So the group went back to the small pyramid, flipped the lever, and ended up in Upper Goblintown (formerly the Halls of Thoth).  As they headed toward the Glory of Weskenim (formerly the Glory of Thoth), they greeted each squad of goblins they met and gave each of them a small barrel of liquor.  By the time they reached Bottleneck Halfling-Slayer, Master Sergeant of Upper Goblintown, they had a fan club of a few dozen already drunk goblins following them, while a few Designated Sober Guards had to stay behind.  Vallium tried to get some information from the goblins, and learned that Gislu the False Prophet had last been seen in the Forum of Set.


GM's Comments:

The plan to trade with the cave people actually worked, despite having no language in common.  It appears that even people who don't know your language know that getting 5 whole axes for one axe head is pretty good.

The party confirmed that the Rugs of Instant Access were useful for skipping the long climb up the Long Stair, at least if someone with Levitation was available.

The Seeker spell once again proved its worth by finding the pyramid control rod in the pit (and incidentally helping find some other treasure in that pits).  But the party already knew of two stairways between the Well of Light level and Upper Goblintown, so this was mostly completionism.

The baboons once again showed that, left unattended, some them will eventually poop on the mirrors.  (I once lived in a huge all-male freshman dorm, so I can confirm this is true.)

Everyone (especially the dwarves) seemed very interested in the Ruby Chair but nobody found a way to move it or break parts off it.

The head of Stamelis seemed to know things, but also seemed reluctant to share Thoth's secrets with random tomb robbers.  Similarly, the ghost of Ptirasa was a mix of helpful and obscure.

Vallium's plan to give goblins $500 of moonshine was a roaring success.  For most of the goblins anyway.  The ones who got Sober Guard Duty with the promise they could have some leftover moonshine later probably didn't like it much.


Achievements:
The Rescuers: 1 XP for freeing Burris from the baboon harem

XP:
Exploration: 9 new locations: 1 XP
Loot: magic axe head, magic axe, Bottomless Purse, Wand of Illumination, coins, etc: 2 XP
Achievements: 1 XP
Total: 4 XP

Next Week:
I expect more testing of the teleport rugs.  Vallium is still looking for a priest of Thoth.  There are still unexplored areas on both the Well of Light and Upper Goblintown levels.  Ioannes may be able to help with some of the mysteries of language or religion that stumped the others.  And if they run out of other things to do, they can always resume their war with the Cult of Set, or explore deeper.

# DFRPG Arden Vul Session 29: The Tower of Scrutiny

Date: 
Horasday, 26th of Besemios, 2993 AE 


Weather: 

Cool, cloudy, chance of rain


Player Characters: 

Vallium Halcyon, Archontean fighter (Greybrown)
Uvash Edzuson, Dwarven cleric of Zodarrim (Cosmo)
Ioannes Grammatikos Byzantios, Archontean cleric of Demma (Demented Avenger)
Ethereum "Coinbase" Thuringwador, Elf Illusionist (Mercenary) (Archon Shiva)


Significant NPCs:

Craastonistorax, large ancient green dragon
4 Wraiths
Yamki, giant 3-armed intelligent baboon
Goat
Trefko, giant 4-armed intelligent baboon
Many baboons
Bottleneck, goblin master sergeant
Many goblins
Gwelf, deceased dwarven thief
Ghoul
Mummy
Many large spiders
3 giant boring beetles


The Plan:


Vallium's plan for the week was:
Leave one Rug of Instant Access at an apartment in the Arcane Practitioners' Club in Gosterwick and then teleport to it from the other Rug every mile or so on the way to Arden Vul, to find the Rugs' maximum range.
Leave the set of silver chess pieces they found last week on the dam as tribute for Craastonistorax.
Try exploring the square tower next to the Forum in the ruins of Arden Vul.  First try to get in the front door, then search for secret doors, then see if the Eyes of Set allowed seeing through the darkness on the stairs down from the roof, then try using ropes or magical flight to send someone down the stairs.
Go through the Pyramid of Thoth to the Well of Light, check on Yamki and the baboons, give the baboons some food if they're behaving, and trade Trefko a live goat (teleported in from Gosterwick using the Rugs) for his Dwarven Life-Stone.  Give Trefko a sheet to cover the mirror at the bottom of the Well when the party isn't using it, rather than having baboons poop on it.
Explore the exit up from the Well of Light, northwest of the Ruby Chair.
Explore the Howling Caves beyond the portcullis.
Go shopping at the Goblin Market.


What Actually Happened:


The Right for Riches company, without Vael or Michael but with Coinbase the head Grudge Brigade Mercenary, left Gosterwick just before dawn on Horasday.  They had a Rug of Instant Access spread out in one apartment, and a live goat left in another apartment (not the same one with the Rug).  On the ten-mile walk to the Cliff Face below Arden Vul, they stopped every mile or so, spread out the Rug, and used it to teleport someone to Gosterwick and back.  When they reached the Cliff Face, everyone except Coinbase stepped through the Rug, Coinbase Levitated up the Cliff Face with the Rug, and then everyone stepped back through the Rug to join Coinbase at the top of the cliff.  Overall, playing with the Rugs took a couple of minutes, but not having to walk all the way up the Long Stair saved over an hour, so this shortened the trip by about an hour while proving that the Rugs' range was at least ten miles.

After reaching the ruins, they walked over to the dam and left a silver Archontean chess set as tribute for the dragon.  They then walked over to the squat square tower by the Forum, where they had long ago found locked doors, bodies on the roof, and stairs down into impenetrable magical darkness.  This time the doors were still locked, and none of the many keys on Vallium's keyring fit.  The whole group circled the base of the tower looking for secret doors, and Uvash found one on the back side of the tower.  Everyone took a close look and nobody saw an obvious way to open it, until Ioannes found a small keyhole.  None of Vallium's keys fit, and nobody had lockpicks or a Lockmaster spell, and the door looked like very sturdy stone that they would not be able to break through, so they gave up on opening the secret door.

Next Coinbase Levitated everyone up, one at a time, riding in the Living Wheelbarrow.  The group assembled above the dark stairs and tried using the Eyes of Set to see through the darkness, but they did not work.  Vallium then borrowed the Ring of Climbing from Uvash, tied a rope around his waist, wrapped the rope around the ibis-head statue, and had Uvash hold onto the other end of the rope.  Vallium then went down the rickety wooden stairs, through the magical darkness, until he came out the other side into a stone passage where his Continual Light stone worked.  He yelled up that he was fine and they could send the next person down.

Ioannes came down next, again with a rope around his waist, but this time the wooden stairs collapsed under him.  Fortunately, Uvash was attentive with the rope and pulled to keep Ioannes from falling more than a couple of feet.  Uvash pulled Ioannes back up, and they switched to Plan B, where Ioannes and Uvash stepped through the Rug, then Coinbase Levitated down the broken stairs with the Rug, with a rope connecting him to Vallium.  Once Coinbase arrived next to Vallium, he laid down the Rug and the others stepped through.

Ioannes noticed that the Sanctity level was low; this place felt evil.  Uvash agreed.  There was a closed door to the north and a passage going south then east, which they followed.  The passage ended at a doorway where the door had been destroyed.  Beyond was a small room containing some destroyed desks, destroyed chairs, destroyed office supplies, another destroyed door on the far side, and a couple of old corpses.  Ioannes tried to diagnose the cause of death and didn't see any obvious wounds.

After failing to find any treasure, they continued north through the other broken door, then west to an intact door, then opened it to find a small room with a spiral stairway going down.  The other door had some writing in blood: "Do not open the doors below! They are waiting!"  Everyone was a bit creeped out, but they went down the stairs anyway.

One level down, they entered a room with three bodies on the floor, two doors (one of them spiked shut from this side), and the spiral stairs continuing down.  The bodies looked from their equipment like a warrior, a wizard, and a Thothian priest.  The equipment included some magic mail armor, a magic shield, a silver scroll case, a magic staff, a greatsword, and a pouch full of small gems.  Vallium shoved all of that into Larel's Sack.  Ioannes examined the bodies and again did not see an obvious cause of death.

They opened the unspiked door and went east then south until they reached a locked door.  Vallium slammed into it hard enough to break the lock.  Inside the room were pegs with ten different magical Thothian masks on them, picturing humans and baboons and ibises.  Nobody felt like trying one on, but they were all magical, so all of them went into the sack.  The door on the other side of the room was locked, and Vallium could not break this one.  They doubled back to the room with the stairs, took all the spikes out, and opened the southern door, which was only stuck not locked.  It led south then east to the other side of the locked door they could not open, so they figured they were done with this level and went back to the spiral stairs and down.

The spiral stairs led to another small room with two exits, and continued down further.  On the floor were a coil of magical rope, a lantern, and some lamp oil.  Vallium put the magic rope in the sack but left the other stuff.  Both doors were locked.  Vallium shouldered both of them hard, but failed to get either one open.  However, he had a file, so he went to work destroying hinges.  The hinges failed before the file broke, so the eastern door was destroyed.

They went east then south to another locked door.  Vallium used the file on this one too.  The southeastern room contained a trap door in the floor, with no obvious locks.  It also had a bunch of pegs on the walls, most of them with the tattered remains of orange Thothian robes, and one containing a bright orange silk robe in good shape, with blue embroidery.  It did not appear magical, so people were suspicious how this robe survived, but Vallium shoved it into the sack anyway.  Vallium then destroyed the hinges on another door, and led the group west.

They could now see the huge brass double doors at the front of the tower from the inside.  There was also some kind of central shaft in the middle of the tower, with a pillar in the middle with Thothian images, and a corpse on the floor in front of it.  The corpse had magical leather armor, a shortsword, and a pouch, so Vallium started taking its stuff and putting it in the sack.  While he did that, he was rudely interrupted by a floating spectral creature coming out of the central shaft.  It reached out with a ghostly hand to touch him.  Vallium fast-drew his sword to parry, but the creature's hand went right through the sword.  Coinbase, standing right next to Vallium, tried a sacrificial block with his magic shield, and that did stop the attack.  So it appeared the wraith was affected by magic shields but not non-magical swords.

A fight began, where Vallium and Coinbase both shield-bashed the wraith (because they had magic shields but not magic weapons), Ioannes started casting Affect Spirits on Vallium's sword, and Uvash moved into position.  They hit the wraith a few times but didn't seem to hurt it much.  In addition to its ghostly touch attack, it also did some kind of ranged contest of Will against Uvash that did enough damage to blow his Bless spell off, and everyone standing near it felt some kind of ghostly toxic effect that was not actually poison.

And then a second wraith appeared.  The fight continued.  Vallium got a good hack in once his sword could Affect Spirits, and Uvash pounded a wraith with Finisher, his mace enchanted against undead.  But that was not enough to stop a wraith.

And then a third wraith appeared.  At that point Coinbase said it was probably time to run.  And everyone did.  And the wraiths pursued.  As a fourth wraith appeared.

The whole group ran south, then east, then north, then west to the spiral stairs, then up two levels, with the wraiths sniffing behind.  Coinbase, the fastest runner, got far enough ahead that he stopped for a couple of seconds to cast Flight on Vallium.  Once they reached the top of the spiral stairs, they ran around the upper level to the bottom of the broken wooden stairs leading to the roof.  By then there was some distance to the wraiths, so Vallium picked up Ioannes and carried him to the roof, then came back and carried Uvash up, while Coinbase Levitated himself to the roof.  Nobody had any safety ropes this time, but they were pretty sure the mana level was fine based on their entry, and nobody thought they could afford the time to set up ropes.

Once everyone reached the roof, Vallium and Coinbase ferried them to the ground at the base of the tower.  No wraiths appeared to be following them, so Ioannes took a few minutes to heal everyone of their wraith wounds, then rested for a few minutes.  That was enough of the Tower of Scrutiny for one day, so the group walked north to the Pyramid of Thoth, manipulated its arms to open the trap door, and went down the steps to the Glory of Thoth.

Vallium knocked on the door and announced himself, and the goblin guards let them in.  There were even more goblins in Upper Goblintown than last time, and many of them were holding small orange gourds full of alcohol.  The giant ibis-headed Thoth statue was wearing a pink turban, sort of resembling the one King Weskenim wore.  Vallium mentioned to Bottleneck that this was the goblins' third week in a row of partying, and Bottleneck said that it was because they had continued to expand their territory, and also it was a goblin holiday celebration.

The group went south and west to the indoor pyramid, flipped the control rod to teleport to the other indoor pyramid on the Well of Light level, and then walked over to visit Yamki.  Yamki said that Trefko was still in his room and was still grumpy but was not causing trouble.  He said that Sisko's harem were still rude but they did not appear to have destroyed anything.  Vallium was satisfied with Yamki's story and gave him a large pile of meat that he pulled out of Larel's Sack.  Yamki gave some of the meat to each of the nearby female baboons, then headed south to the Howling Caves to feed the others.

The group headed north and west to Trefko's room.  They knocked on the door and Trefko opened it.  Trefko asked if they had his goat.  Vallium said to wait a minute, then went around a corner, spread out the Rug, walked through to the apartment in Gosterwick, went to the apartment next door with the goat, grappled the goat, and carried it back through the Rug.  He carried the squirming goat over toward Trefko.  Coinbase tried a Levitation on the goat to make it float peacefully, but the goat stubbornly resisted the spell.  Trefko ended the commotion by reaching out with two of his huge arms to grab the goat.  He then removed his dwarven life-stone necklace with his other two hands, and gave it to Uvash.  The life-stone said "Schist Corundam" in Dwarven Runic, which Uvash identified as a dwarven name, with Schist being the given name and Corundam a clan name.  Vallium asked Trefko how things were going, and he said he preferred his quiet room to all the noisy kids in the Howling Caves.  Vallium said that was fine, as long as Trefko kept the others from vandalizing the mirrors.  He gave Trefko a sheet that he could use to cover the mirror when it wasn't being used.

The party then went north and west to the hole in the ceiling.  Vallium pulled a ladder out of Larel's Sack to make it easier to reach, and everyone went up. They went north through a narrow natural cavern passage, until it opened into a cavern.  The cavern contained a half-eaten dwarf corpse, which Ioannes recognized as Gwelf, the dwarf they had freed from Gerrilad's prison, who had then run off.  Gwelf appeared to have taken a fatal blow from a large cutting weapon.  Uvash cast Final Rest on Gwelf, while Ioannes cast Bless on Uvash to replace the Bless that had absorbed a wraith attack.

The room also contained a couple of statues, a 4' marble whippet and a 5' bronze Ptah.  The bronze statue took all of Vallium's strength to budge.  Uvash spotted a single ancient gold solidi coin on the floor.  Coinbase cast Lighten Burden to make it a bit easier to manage, and Vallium took both statues and Gwelf's body through the Rug to their apartment.  While he was there, he dumped a bunch of newly found loot out of Larel's Sack.

There were two exits from the cavern, a passage north at ground level and a passage west about 25' up.  Coinbase Levitated up to take a look, but didn't see much.  The group decided "Right for Riches" meant north, and then they turned right at a fork.  This led to a passage that went down a long way, as the passage got drier.  After about half a mile of descending, the party decided to turn around and went back.

They took a few more right turns and then entered a huge underground graveyard.  There were sarcophagi scattered all over, some with blank lids, others with gisants with pictures of people and sometimes names carved in Mithric, always "Brother Someone."  Coinbase tentatively flew around to map the room, and found several mausoleums along the north and south walls.  The room felt creepy, with Low Sanctity.  After much discussion, they decided to take the lid off a sarcophagus near the entrance where it would be easier to run.  Inside was an inert mummy and some ancient silver coins.  They decided not to rob the grave, and opened a second one.  This one contained a ghoul, who attacked them.  It was four on one, so the ghoul didn't last long.  There was also some silver in this one, and they decided to take it, since the ghoul had attacked them.

After more discussion, they decided to open the door of the mausoleum in the southwest corner.  Inside was a platform with a mummy on it.  The mummy sat up, and everyone ran -- after a recent fight with two mummies, and fleeing for their lives from four wraiths, they didn't feel like a fight with one mummy plus a possibly large number of its friends.  Once they left the graveyard room, nothing seemed to follow.

They took another right turn and went northeast, to where they spotted three giant beetles munching on the corpse of a bull-headed biped.  Coinbase summoned a couple of semi-illusionary phantoms, and they grappled the beetles while Vallium stabbed them.  There was no treasure, but Vallium rug-teleported the half-eaten minotaur corpse and one of the beetle corpses back to their apartment.

They then went west until they found a room with a lot of spider webs.  Some large spiders started jumping down and bit one of Coinbase's illusions, actually dispelling it.  There were enough spiders that the group decided they should leave rather than contining the fight, and they fled from the third battle of the delve.

The group found a crossroads with three exits, labeled "E" and "W" and "N" in big red letters.  They continued in the direction they thought was southeast (despite the labels) until Vallium accidentally discovered a pit trap and started to fall in.  He used his Luck to reroll his DX check then caught himself on the edge.  After he climbed out, they pulled the cover off and looked in the pit.  Not finding any treasure, they continued and found a second covered pit.  There was nothing inside that one either.  After bypassing the pits, they made it back to their entrance to this level, and went back to the Well of Light.  They visited the Library to grab the broken tripod for the mirror, and put it in Larel's Sack to bring it back to Gosterwick for repair.  Then they walked back home.



GM's Comments:


They escaped the Tower of Scrutiny without dying.  The wraiths are no joke.  They found the Tower back in Session 1 with 125 point PCs, and if they'd gone in back then, it probably would have been a TPK.  But now they're powerful enough to run away more effectively.  (Also, props to Coinbase for calling for retreat at the right time.  Another couple of turns and they might not have made it.)

When the party found that deeply descending tunnel and turned around, they didn't actually want to turn around.  I told them the map they were approaching wasn't ready, so they had to turn around (or pause there), but it would be ready for next session.  This is the first time this has happened in this campaign, so they got an achievement for it.  (It's a one-time-only achievement as I don't want them deliberately trying to exceed the limits of the mapped area.)

The Rugs of Instant Access are the kind of magic item that totally changes the game.  They players are still figuring them out, but got a lot of use out of them.  (Including questionable uses like teleporting random monster corpses back to their apartments.)


Achievements:

Outsmarted the GM: 1 XP for reaching an area where the map wasn't ready (one time only)

XP:
Exploration: 1 XP for 15 new locations
Loot: It sounds like they'll sell enough of the magic armor and masks to get 2 XP
Achievements: 1 XP
Total: 4 XP

Next Week:

My guess is they won't go back to the Tower of Scrutiny.  They might resume exploring the tunnels above the Well of Light, or try to finish the unexplored parts of the Well of Light or Halls of Thoth, or go looking for the Troll Lifts, or something else.  They keep finding new places to explore faster than they finish exploring old places.

Before setting off for Arden Vul, Vallium bought a fresh high-quality sweetroll from one of Gosterwick's bakers.  The group hiked uneventfully through the cool and somewhat rainy morning to the Cliff Face.  The waterfall looked a bit less violent than usual, but nobody was certain what effect their meddling with the dam control had.  Vael asked Vallium to push his wheelbarrow up the Long Stair and decided to Levitate instead of walk.  He stayed with the group, however, rather than just zooming straight up and splitting the party.  Nobody slipped on the way up, despite the somewhat treacherous conditions.  The group stopped at the gateway to Arden Vul to discuss a plan, and decided to proceed north to revisit the Pyramid of Thoth.

But as they walked, they spotted a large flying reptilian beast off to the west, coming toward them.  It flew overhead, took a good look, then flew back to the west.  It had the distinctive tail barb like the one they saw before, but this time didn't attempt to drop anything on them.

They continued toward the Pyramid, and then saw an even larger flying reptilian beast approaching, without the barbed tail.  This one actually landed on the Forum nearby.  It was clearly a green dragon, and it was huge, and it was terrifying.  Most of the group was strongly afffected by dragon fear, but chose to freeze rather than flee.  The others also stayed with them.  The dragon introduced himself as Craastonistorex, the apex predator of the ruins of Arden Vul.  He spoke a bit about how he found some adventurers useful, as they went into places too small for him to go, extracted treasure, and gave some of it to him as tribute.  He then mentioned that one of his pet wyverns had spotted some humans and elves and dwarves breaking into the dam the week before, and that soon afterward the water level of the swamp had started to rise.  He asked whether any of those here were among those who broke into the dam, and emphasized that lying might have fatal consequences.

The two PCs who hadn't been there the week before immediately proclaimed their innocence, while those who had apologetically revealed that they had been at the dam.  Craastonistorex asked whether they had been sent to deliberately mess with his swamp, or if they had just been idiots messing with things they did not understand.  Multiple simultaneous confessions of idiocy ensued.  The dragon instructed them to return to the dam, reset the water level to where it had been before, leave notes both inside and outside the dam warning against disturbing the dam again on pain of breath weapon, and to leave some good tribute by the dam.  The group agreed, and the dragon warned them to stay away from his tower to the southwest because his pet wyverns were territorial and sometimes ate anyone who came too close.  He then flew away.

The party kept the first part of the deal, immediately hiking to the dam and resetting the water level.  Vael half-heartedly stuck to the second part of the deal, chalking a couple of brief warnings inside and outside the dam.  They didn't leave any tribute by the dam though, and hiked back to the pyramid.  The three who had entered the pyramid last week explained the way pointing both statue arms forward had opened a passage to stairs down.  Vael said that before they took the same stairs, he wanted to try all the other statue arm settings and see if they found anything else.  Remembering the pits and chutes that playing with the other statue's arms had opened, Vael first cast Levitation and asked the others to back up as far as possible.  He then tried every other setting of the statue's arms.  Pointing them both straight up at the sky produced an interesting result -- the floor panel slid the other way, revealing a different staircase going down into the pyramid in the opposite direction.  The other settings didn't do anything interesting.

Looking down into the new stairs, a couple of people noticed a lack of a handle to open the door from the inside.  That was a bit scary, so they decided to leave some of the group on top of the pyramid to reopen the door.  Ioannes went down the stairs alone a bit, and saw that these stairs were much less worn than the other ones, that there were pictures of various animals (hippo, crocodile, ibis, baboon, giraffe) on the front of the stairs, and that there were some corpses on the stairs.  Also, one of the corpses was wearing leather armor that looked magical.

The corpses and lack of an obvious exit said stop, but the magic armor said loot, so the group descended on the bodies.  Ioannes tried to diagnose cause of death and saw multiple causes: some gnaw marks, some cut wounds, and some blunt trauma.  They decided not to go down these stairs today, but grabbed all the visible loot and dragged it to the top of the staircase, then left most of it there to grab later.  They instead reset the statue's arms to face forward and reveal the staircase they took last week, which didn't feature corpses.

Plodding down the stairs, they found the room at the bottom of the first staircase still had the orange Continual Light glowing.  Magery didn't pick it up as a permanent enchantment though.   They continued down the second staircase, and eventually emerged in the room with the statue of Thoth with the offering chest.  The halfling toll collectors noticed them, came out to greet them, and saw two new party members who had not yet purchased Adventuring Licenses.  50 silver pieces later, Coinbase and Michael each had a dull brass token giving them permission to adventure in halfling territory as long as they paid a tithe of 10% of treasure found.  Vallium produced the sweetroll he had purchased early that morning in Gosterwick and gave it to Roskelly, the halfling lieutenant, as a gift.  Roskelly seemed surprised, but took it.

Once the halflings went back to their portcullis, Vallium wanted to play with the statue of Thoth in the entry room.  They had tried coins and a scroll before, but he remembered that Thoth liked light, so he put a Continual Light stone and some coins in the offering chest and then manipulated the statue's arms.  This did not produce any obvious effect, and he took his rock and coins back.

Vael cast Seek Earth, looking for gold then silver.  The nearest gold was to the east, behind the halfling portcullis.  The nearest silver was southwest, which seemed more promising.  Rather than heading directly for the silver, the group decided to explore the indoor triangular pyramid, also to the southwest.  The walked through the gray-green mist, past the Magic Mouth illusion that said something in a language they didn't know, and up to the pyramid.  This time they climbed to the top.  There was a small trangular platform there, surfaced with lapis lazuli, and with an aged but not rusted metal lever on top.  After some discussion, Vael cast Levitation, asked everyone else to step back, and pushed the lever down while floating a few inches above the pyramid.  Nothing happened.  Next Michael pushed the lever while standing on the platform -- and disappeared!  After a bit of discussion the other four also hit the lever, two at a time, with Vael this time standing on the pyramid.

All five of them ended up standing on an almost identical pyramid, with the same platform on top, but no lever this time.  They climbed down, left the room to the north, and realized they were definitely in a different spot as the room had a mosaic (of the same triangular pyramid) on the floor, along with a couple of corpses.  There was a message on the wall in blood: “They are deterred by light. We should restore the well!”  They looted the corpses, with Vallium taking and putting on some scale armor.  The only remaining exit from that room led to an east-west hallway, with light in both directons.  They went east, and found a bunch of mirrors along the hall, most of them stationary, a couple mobile.  They also saw a thin shaft of daylight ahead.  They took a hallway to the southeast and found a little room with some benches facing a yellow circle on the wall and some Mythric writing saying “The Light Must Be Guarded Against the Impious.”

Going back to the northeast to investigate the daylight, they saw that it was the bottom of a 5' wide mirror-lined shaft leading up into the distance.  Below the shaft was a smelly pile of mud and dung, covering something.  Vael thought he recognized the mirror-lined shaft, and looked around for the Continual Light rock he had previously dropped.  He didn't find any glowing rock, but he did find a rock that might have once had Continual Light cast on it.  As the group discussed trying to uncover whatever was under the muck, they heard some hoots and shrieks to the north.  Someone was getting beat up.  They decided to investigate, but carefully.  They put away their light sources and sneaked forward.  Far to the north was a bizarre scene: a huge room, containing a throne that appeared to be made of red glass, a bunch of large albino baboons, and couple of huge four-armed baboons, and a man torturing a dwarf prisoner, asking about how he found the entrance, while the baboons cheered him on.  Considering the odds, the group decided to leave the dwarf to his fate and retreat to the south.

After some discussion about possibly Levitating up the mirror shaft or possibly exploring more of this area, the group decided to finish digging through the muck first.  Underneath was a huge mirror, and when they uncovered it the room lit up brightly.  The light reached some of the other mirrors, which could be manipulated to direct light around the area.  However, doing this caused the sounds of baboon hooting to become louder.  The group decided to Levitate everyone up the Well of Light before the baboons got over their fear of the light and attacked.  They ran back to the room with the corpses, grabbed all the loot they could carry, then Vael Levitated everyone up the shaft.  He wasn't confident in being able to maintain five Levitation spells at once, so they split the party, with Vael taking two people up (slowly, taking alternating Concentrate maneuvers to move one of them at a time), coming down alone, then taking the other two up.  Fortunately, the baboons had not found the courage to charge into the brightly lit room until the party had escaped.

Vael remembered something the dragon had said about baboons to the east, and decided he should investigate a bit to the east, thinking maybe the baboons had an entrance to the surface.  A dry fountain revealed the huge marble probably-feminine arm of a broken statue, which interestingly appeared magic, but seemed too heavy to take, so they left it there.  He cast Seek Earth a couple more times looking for gold and silver, and found gold west under the pyramid, and silver west under the Well of Light.

The group decided to go back down the stairs into the Pyramid of Thoth again.  First they used the statue to reveal the scary stairs and stashed more loot there, then they went down the safe stairs back to the halfling room.  They weren't eager to reveal to the halflings that they had an alternate exit, but failed to sneak past them, and told Roskelly a story about a trap that ended up depositing them outside in a way they totally couldn't repeat.  They weren't sure if Roskelly bought it, but a quick pat-down revealed no hidden treasure, and the party was coming in not going out, so the halflings let them go to explore.

This time they went back to the nest of the giant rats they defeated last week, hoping to find more treasure they had missed.  The nest was empty, but as they explored north they found one burial niche that was still plugged closed, apparently not looted.  It was about 12' up, so Vael Levitated Michael up.  Michael wiped the soot off the niche plug and found both an image of ibis-headed Thoth with his left arm forward and his right arm down, and a sigil of a tower with light shining out of one window.  Several people recognized this as the symbol of the Krakteros family, one of the five leading families of the empire.  Undeterred, the group decided to smash the plug open, but nobody had a crowbar and Michael didn't have any weapons he wanted to risk breaking.  Coinbase, however, had an orichalcum shield that was probably unbreakable, so Vael Levitated the elf up next to Michael, and Coinbase started smashing his ridiculously expensive shield into the tomb plug, treating it like a crowbar.  The shield withstood the damage fine, and the plug eventually broke.

The animated skeleton behind the plug had ample warning and was waiting with its shortsword drawn to ambush the tomb robbers, but Coinbase critically succeeded on his Perception roll and the skeleton failed its ambush attack.  Coinbase tried using Rapier Wit to stun the skeleton with some pseudo-financial babble, but the skeleton appeared immune to such nonsense.  The skeleton tried to stab Michael, but Coinbase sacrificially blocked the blow.  Michael smacked the skeleton hard with his sword, Vael lowered Michael to the ground, and the others waited below, unable to reach the skeleton.  The skeleton next attacked Coinbase, who blocked again with his shield.  Michael fast-drew his boomerang and winged it at the skeleton, breaking some ribs.  Vael lowered Coinbase to the ground, and now the skeleton had no enemies within shortsword range.  The skeleton bravely jumped to the ground to pursue its enemies, and made its default Acrobatics roll to avoid taking any falling damage.  However, that meant it was outnumbered five to one.  Coinbase blocked the skeleton's last attack, while Vallium and Michael raced to smash it to bits.  The skeleton parried Vallium's attack, but failed to block Michael's, which knocked it below -HP, which was automatic destruction for the Unnatural skeleton.

With the skeleton in pieces, Vael floated Michael back up to loot its niche.  There Michael found a green necklace (with the same Krakteros tower symbol that had been on the niche plug before Coinbase smashed it) and three small black spheres.  He brought them back down for inspection, and Vael used his Merchant skill to say the necklace was jade and the spheres were black pearls and that all were valuable.  The skeleton's shortsword also appeared to be high quality.  After grabbing all the loot, the group went back to the south.  This time they headed east, triggering first the Magic Mouth in an unknown language they'd heard twice before, then a second Magic Mouth in Archontean mocking Thoth and his worshippers.

Spotting a wooden door leading south, Ioannes first listened at it.  Hearing nothing, Vallium opened it.  A stone passage led south to another door, where they repeated the process.  The next room contained a makeshift wooden barricade, with doors to the south and east.  There was a halfling head on a spike in front of the south door.  Vallium went that way to check it out, and stepped on a spike trap crossing the barricade.  Fortunately, it was a glancing blow, and his newly-looted scale armor prevented any real damage.

Wondering who put a halfling head on a spike, but generally in favor of the idea, the group continued south.  They went past a door on the west wall, turned east past a line of slits in the north wall, and looked through a pair of large double doors, which were slightly open.  There was a large room beyond, extending past the range of their Continual Light stones.  As they started to enter the room, a horn sounded from behind the slits to the north.  A few seconds later, some drums replied form the east.  Not sure exactly what they were walking into, the group decided to retreat.  However Vael could not resist peeking into one of the slits, and found himself face-to-face with a 4' tall pig-headed beastman.  They were both surprised to see each other at such close range, neither attacked, and Vael quickly stepped to the side.

Not wanting to return to the surface yet, Ioannes listened to the previously bypassed door to the west, then Vallium opened it and stepped inside.  He didn't see the deadfall trap above the door, which dropped several large rocks on him.  Fortunately they were just painfully large rocks, not fatally huge rocks, and his armor somewhat reduced the damage.  A corridor led west, with exits north and south and an open door further to the west.  Beyond the open door was a room with a chest against the back wall.  Everyone was suspicious of the chest, but nobody could resist investigating it, so the group entered the room.  Vael got about five yards from the chest to have a decent chance of casting Apportation, then remotely opened the lid.  The chest was empty, but it had served its purpose of luring the group into the room, as someone behind them slammed the door shut then barred it from the outside.  They were trapped, by someone unknown.

There were more horn noises, and after a few minutes and the sound of a lot of shuffling feet, a voice was heard from the other side.  Who were they, were they allied with the halflings, and why were they in the territory of the Children of Deino?  The group explained that they were adventurers, they had met and been extorted by the halflings but were not their allies, and that they had not deliberately invaded anyone's territory.  The unseen speaker paused a bit, then said this trespass would be forgiven the first time, but that future visits needed to be announced and permitted, no sneaking around their territory allowed.  He then stated that the group should listen for the door to be unbarred, wait 30 seconds for the Children of Deino to leave the area, then proceed immediately out of Children of Deino territory back to the north.  Remembering a rumor about pig-headed creatures kidnapping a cleric and a reward offered for her recovery, Vael asked if the unseen speaker knew anything about a priestess of Mitra named Lillian and offered to pay for her safe return.  The voice hesitated, then said they currently held no such priestess captive.  Vael tried again and got no more information.  The party complied and left without violence.  On the way out, they grabbed the spike with the halfling head.

They took a new passage to the northeast toward the halflings, and spotted a fresco of a baboon.  Remembering a rumor about a baboon picture, they searched the fresco for secret doors, and found one.  A few minutes later they figured out how to open it, and saw that behind the secret door were some stairs leading down.  They didn't go down the stairs, and closed the secret door.

Returning to the halfling territory, Coinbase gave the halfling head on the spike to Roskelly and said that should be enough tribute.  Roskelly passed the head to another halfling and said to bring it to Plumthorn, then said no and demanded to see the treasure.  Vael, having hidden the pearls and necklace, said the only treasure they found was the shortsword.  Roskelly said that since you couldn't usefully split up a shortsword, 10% of a shortsword was the whole shortsword and to hand it over, but Vael protested that they should really only have to pay 10% of the price of a shortsword, and offered 40 silver pieces.  Coinbase couldn't resist negotiating and said it was a used shortsword and so it should be more like 16 silver, but then Roskelly went back to asking for the whole sword, and Vael (who knew it was actually a pretty nice sword worth more than the usual), handed over the 40 silver before the halflings got too suspicious.  The halflings performed a quick pat-down search but didn't find the hidden gems or jewels, and the group returned to the surface, then made it back safely to Gosterwick.

GM's Comments:

Well that was a whirlwind session.
A green dragon
Another staircase into the Pyramid of Thoth, this one much scarier than the first one
A teleporter
The bottom of the Well of Light, and hallways full of lots of mirrors
Many baboons, a couple of huge four-armed baboons, and a creepy guy torturing a dwarf
An undead skeleton
A couple of traps
At least one pig-headed beastman hiding behind an arrow slit
Some unseen Children of Deino who trapped the party in a room, then let them go
Secret stairs down
They managed to avoid fighting the dragon, the baboons, or the Children of Deino, this time.  They grabbed a bunch of unguarded loot, plus defeated the skeleton and took its stuff.

Achievements:

Iconic Location: Well of Light: The whole party got this achievement for being the first to find the Well of Light.  (They found just the top of it previously, but this time they fully explored it.)

XP:
Exploration: about 16 new locations, good for 1 XP
Loot: some magic leather armor, a potion, some black pearls, a jade necklace, a nice shortsword, a suit of scale armor, and some random equipment and a few coins.  Even after subtracting some bribes to the halflings (two more Adventuring Licenses, $40 for 10% of a shortsword, and a sweetroll for Roskelly), that will end up being profitable enough for 2XP, assuming they have Coinbase sell most of the equipment they found, using his Wealth to get a better price.
Bonus: 1 XP for everyone for the Iconic Location.
Next week:

It sounds like they're going to keep exploring the halfling level.  They don't like paying off the halflings, and there's been some vague discussion of fighting the halflings, but they don't seem ready yet.  It seems they're more likely to try to sneak treasure around the halflings than fight them, at least in the near term.

What Happened:


Uvash led some members of his dwarven flock to bury the fallen dwarf adventurer Gwelf, whose body they had found in a cavern the previous week.

Lyssandra left messages on everyone's apartment doors at the Arcane Practitioners' Club, that livestock and corpses were not permitted on the premises.  Also that all apartment tenants must leave by the first of Dikaios, when renovations to the top floor would commence.  The lounge, alchemy labs, training rooms, and library on the lower floors would not be affected.

Creon sent Vael a note that he had some newly arrived magical items.  The items were a very expensive magical knife, a suit of magical scale armor, and an invisibility potion.  Vael didn't buy any of them, but paid Creon a tip for continuing to let him know about interesting items before they went on the shelves.  Vael did spot and purchase a couple of items from market peddlers: a mapping kit and a hands-free helmet lamp.

Vael went looking for Wicktrimmer to see if he had any ideas about apartments, but the goblin was not available.

The Right for Riches company left for Arden Vul just after dawn on Lunday.  They made it to the base of the waterfall without encountering anyone, but saw a trail of people and mules heading up, about a quarter of the way up the Long Stair.  Everyone else stepped through the Rug back to Gosterwick, then Vael Levitated about halfway up the Long Stair to outside the secret entrance to the Great Cavern, and let the others come back through.  They waited there for the mule train, which turned out to be a merchant and six armed guards, each leading a mule.  Two of the guards came forward to talk.  They revealed that they were heading up to the Inn of the Broken Head with supplies.  Once he was convinced of their peaceful intentions, the merchant, Flavius Aurelius, came up to chat.  He revealed that he and his men regularly brought supplies from Gosterwick up to the Broken Head.  Vael asked to exchange contact information so they could talk again sometime in Gosterwick, and Flavius agreed.

Once the mule train was out of sight, the party opened the secret door, and Vallium led them east then north then west through narrow passages into the Great Cavern proper.  They repeated the trick with everyone stepping through the Rug, Vallium Levitating up to the top of the rock outcropping, then everyone stepping back out.  The shaft they wanted to explore was about 5 feet in diameter and extended beyond the range of their light sources.  Vael cast Trace on his Returning Pebble then dropped it into the hole.  The spell told him that it fell about 70 feet, bounced a few times, then settled there.  Vael was a bit nervous to fly down into the hole alone, so Vallium tied a 100 foot rope around his waist, spiked it in place at the top and had the others hold it, and then climbed down while Vael Levitated.  At the bottom was a cavern and there did not appear to be any danger, so Vallium stayed at the bottom to stand guard, while Vael flew up, let everyone step into the Rug, flew down, and let everyone step out.

The group explored the small cave.  It was unoccupied, but had a few interesting features.  There was what looked like a black flowering plant, impossibly growing in the pitch dark.  There was also a sheet spread out on the ground.  On the sheet were a couple of flasks of a strange light orange material, a couple of small discs of a strange heavy orange material, some unidentifiable dried fruit, and some unidentifiable and extremely old dried meat.  They took the objects, left the old food, and did not disturb the plant.

There was another shaft heading down.  Vael again cast Trace on his Pebble and dropped it.  This time it fell around 170' before bouncing around a bit.  That was longer than any rope they had, so Vael sent down a Wizard Eye spell to explore.  The spell revealed a cavern complex, with one large cavern containing a pool of water, and another tunnel sloping down.  It looked unoccupied, so Vael had everyone step into the Rug, flew down, and let everyone step out.

The group thoroughly explored the cave.  They didn't find any occupants or treasure, or any exits except for the tunnel sloping down.  Vallium swam around in the chilly pool, which appeared to be fresh water, about 30' deep.  Eventually they took the tunnel down, but then turned back around before exploring the deeper level.  Everyone climbed back up, then stepped into the Rug, and Vael flew all the way up to the rock then back down to the surface of the Great Cavern, and everyone stepped back out.

They walked west a bit to the base of the pillar atop which Vael had seen some kind of classical temple.  He flew up to take a look, then repeated the Rug trick to teleport everyone else up.  There was what looked like a classical marble temple on top of the pillar, and in the center of it was a large sarcophagus.  It was surrounded by 8 urns, about 4' in diameter and 4' tall.  There was a Mithric inscription on the sarcophagus:

Here rests Ptarmis
loyal servant of Thoth
seeker of hidden ways
who destroyed the loathsome ones
raised his children from spores
and opened this cavern
Those who disturb his sleep
Will be returned to the mulch
from whence they came.

This was a bit confusing, since they'd met a man named Ptarmis, on the throne a bit to the east, who was very much alive.  Vael looked over to see if he was there, and he was.  He flew over to chat.  Ptarmis indicated that the temple was his, like everything in the Great Cavern was his, and that they should leave it alone.  Surprisingly, the party complied, and left without opening the sarcophagus or the urns.

Next they continued west to the Settite outpost.  Vael used Larel's Cloak to turn invisible, and cast Infravision so he could hide his light, and flew over to check it out.  There were no guards on the landing.  He kicked the rope ladder down so the others could climb up, and explored into the tunnel to the west.  The stores of food were gone, and then all the furniture in the Settite guard lounge room was gone.  It looked like the Settites had abandoned the area.  The door north was locked, but Vallium had a key, and unlocked it, then another door north, then another door west, to find the stairs leading down to the Forum of Set level.

The group snuck down the stairs, wary of the Varumani guards they saw last time, but this time they didn't see any varumani in the octagonal crossroads room.  There was just one bat, suspiciously orbiting the room.  Chrysalis decided she didn't like the bat, and used her long staff to knock it down, fatally.  When it hit the ground, its corpse changed from a bat into a strange worm, and remained dead.

They explored a few tunnels until they found a large room to the south.  There were 6 plinths, with name plaques.  5 of them contained statues, with 4 of the statues complete and one of them headless, with colorful magical sparks shooting out of its neck.  There was a separate smaller platform in front of each plinth.  There were large letters in Mithric on the south wall "Let the Worthy Illuminate the" and then the sentence was rudely interrupted by a hole in the wall.  The missing statue was "Priscus Pulcher, the Arch-Sortian" and there were some fresh flowers there.  The intact statues were "Licinia the Seer", "Plotinus Quartus Claudino, Archon", "Yeth, Who Sought to Bring Law to Chaos", and "Horatius Interfector, Sorcerer."  The headless statue with the spark show was "Thrygga the Mighty", and he was wearing some impossibly fantastic armor, a bit similar to what the Sun-Scarred Knight Sir Sorrow had worn.  Some of these names were vaguely familar but none of the party was a historian.  Vael tried putting Continual Light stones near each statue, which didn't seem to do anything.  He also put a piece of paper in the spark shower and succeeded in setting it on fire.

Tiring of the statues, the group explored a few more tunnels, then went west, to a big blue pillar they had seen before.  The pillar had statues on several sides: of a handsome man, a woman, a varumani, a Thothian priest, and a goblin.  Vallium had made a note to bring old coins, but had not actually brought any.  Fortunately they had the teleport rugs, so he walked through one back to their apartments, grabbed several coins and gems, and came back.  He determined that the woman's eyes were a perfect fit for gold solidi, and the priest's eyes for ancient silver pennies.  The handsome man's eyes, varumani's mouth, and goblin's nose also had holes, but none of those matched the size of any coins or gems in their collection.  Vallium put two solidi in the woman's eye holes, and the whole group was instantly half-blinded by bright light as they were teleported outside, near the old Archon's palace.  Unfortunately they were about ten feet above the ground, so everyone (except Vael, who still had Levitation on) fell to the ground with a painful thump.  While Ioannes healed falling damage, Uvash mentioned that he had seen a short obelisk on the other side of the palace wall, before they fell.  Vael Levitated up and saw that the obelisk was covered with lunar symbols and had an ankh-shaped hole, much like the Obelisk of the Sun near the entrance to Arden Vul, except this one had been broken and only the bottom 10 feet remained.

Remembering something they had read about sun and moon and stars, the group determined that if they'd found the moon obelisk, they should see if they could find the star obelisk to complete the set.  Vael looked for a third obelisk on the line between the others but didn't see it.  He then tried a Seeker spell, concentrating on the moon obelisk, to find another one like it but with stars.  He was rewarded with a vision of the Obelisk of the Stars, in the swamp to the southwest.  He flew up and looked that way, until he also spotted it with the naked eye.  They considered visiting all the obelisks now, but something in the story they remembered had said "mid-day", and it was already afternoon, so they decided to come back another day before noon in case the exact timing mattered.

The group decided to go back to the Blue Pillar.  They walked east across the bridge toward the Pyramid of Thoth, south through the Forum, past the scary Tower of Scrutiny, past the Obelisk of the Sun, and down the Long Stair to the secret door.  They then retraced their steps across the Great Cavern to the west, climbed the rope ladder into the former Set outpost, went down the stairs, and went west again to the Blue Pillar.  After all that walking, and with no significant loot found, Vael announced that it was time to look for treasure, and cast Seek Earth looking for platinum.  He sensed some, a bit to the northwest.  There were no passages going that way, and nobody found any secret doors, so they went east then north up some stairs, hoping they could loop around.  The stairs went up a long way, and there were periodic frescoes of faces in agony.  There were also some magical noses on the walls, which started sniffing as they passed.  No enemies came, so the group ignored the noses and pressed on.

Ahead, they heard some conversation, as if someone was searching for someone.  They snuck up and saw four Settites, facing the other way toward a closed door.  Wordlessly, they ambushed the Settites.  Vallium shield-rushed one to the ground, chopped him up, then chopped another one.  Mariposa the monkey tied one of the Settites up in cloaks, while Chrysalis smashed him with a staff.  Uvash paused for a second to activate his Divine Grace, then ran up behind a wounded Settite and smashed his skull in.  The last surviving Settite tried to surrender, but nobody wanted to deal with prisoners, and he died under a hail of cuts and blows from all sides.

Vallium forced open the door to the west, and there was a large man hiding behind it.  Seeing they were not dressed like Settites, he came out and revealed that his name was Harold and that he'd been hiding from the slavers.  He had come to the Halls with an adventuring group to explore old tombs and take treasures that their owners no longer needed.  But then their leader, Gillen, had decided to turn bandit, capturing travelers and selling them to the slavers.  Harold considered himself a respectable tomb robber, not an evil bandit or slaver, so left the group.  Unfortunately he had gotten lost and had attracted the attention of the Settite "Guild of Service" and thought he was about to be captured and thrown into a slave pit, until the Right for Riches company came and killed the slavers.  They believed his story, and offered to guide him out.

Everyone continued north up the stairs to another room, in which two badly wounded men were stapled to a punishment frame.  One was missing both hands, unconscious, and bleeding to death.  The other was in better shape, and identified himself as Hjalti.  He said the other man was Kiglon.  Ioannes healed both of them, then they let both men down.  Neither looked to be in any shape to walk far, so he cast more healing spells until both men were able to walk a bit better and Kiglon woke up.  Then they told both men that they would be able to teleport them to a temple in Gosterwick where they would be safe, if they promised not to reveal the secret of the teleportation.  Both men agreed, as did Harold, and then Ioannes took all three of them through the Rug, back to an apartment at the Arcane Practitioner's Club in Gosterwick, then to the Temple of Demma.  Ioannes came back through the Rug alone about 30 minutes later, and the others had not been interrupted.

Vael tried another Seek Earth spell and detected platinum again, this time to the southwest.  Figuring they'd missed a secret door, he pulled out the Wand of See Secrets and used a charge.  It immediately found a secret door to the southwest.  He ran around the previously explored territory until the spell ran out, but didn't find any more secrets.  Returning to the secret door that the wand had found, Vael was able to see the outline of the door, but not a handle or a catch or a keyhole or any way to open it.  Everyone else looked, and nobody else found anything either.  Vael used Shape Earth to just rip a hole in the wall, which worked.

A narrow passage and a few steps down led to a room with several empty sarcophagi and a workbench with some tools and jars.  The jars contained some kind of embalming spices.  There was an obvious door north, but some searching found a secret door south.

Behind the secret door was a small room containing a blood-encrusted altar.  Both clerics felt the sanctity level dip to Pure Evil.  The non-clerics searched the altar but didn't find anything.  Ioannes exorcised it, which made him feel better but didn't diminish the feeling of evil.  Eventually Chrysalis got suspicious and figured out the altar was a scary illusion, and put her staff through it.  Once she pointed it out, the others were able to see it as well, and they searched the room and found another secret door leading south.

The room to the south contained a big block of granite, like a sarcophagus but with no obvious lid or way to open it.  It had a small hemispherical depression on the top.  It was inscribed "Theskelon is in me I am in Theskelon" and "Let Set devour the rays of his old rival".  The plastered walls had several Settite images that were a combination of flat painting and three dimensional sculpture, with some real objects incorporated.  There was a black boar with a sun in its jaws, a crocodile eating a heron, a Set animal squatting on a turtle, and a human priest of Set chopping a baboon with an axe.  The sun, the boar's eye, the heron's legs, the turtle shell, and the axe head were distinct objects.

Everyone got into position, and Vallium tried smashing the granite block, which did nothing.  Chrysalis then tried a Power Blow to smash the block harder, still nothing.  Finally Vael told the warriors to stand aside and used a Shape Earth spell to open the block, which also failed.

Someone asked about the size of the sun versus the depression, and the sun was a bit too big to fit.  Vallium ripped the sun off the wall and started peeling the plaster off the outside, revealing a golden orb that would fit in the depression.  Once he inserted it, the granite shell exploded into dust, revealing a smaller gold and lapis sarcophagus, shaped like a Settite priest with folded arms.

Vallium opened the inner sarcophagus, but as he did a fire trap exploded, burning him.  All the others who were foolishly standing too close had to dive out of the way, but none were injured.  Ioannes healed Vallium's burns, and then they looked inside the sarcophagus.  It contained some human bones with gold signet ring (inscribed "Theskelon the Master") around one finger.  There were also three copper plaques with maps on them, along with glyphs in an unknown language and notes in Mithric.  There were three books, one in Mithric (about creating mummies) and two in unknown languages.  Finally, there was a key, which Vallium immediately added to his huge keyring.

Uvash cast Final Rest on the bones, hoping that would stop them from going undead and attacking.  Vallium set up the Rug and carried the gold and lapis inner sarcophagus (which was too big to fit in Larel's Sack and too heavy easily carry home) through, then came back.  They gathered up the other treasure in Larel's Sack, then retraced their steps back to Gosterwick.

GM's Comments:

This blog is starting to feel like an infomercial for the Rugs of Instant Access.  ("But that's not all!  If you order in the next ten minutes we'll throw in a third Rug!")

For the second week in a row, we had some technical difficulties in Foundry VTT.  Last week it was the PCs trying to visit a map that wasn't ready, my fault.  This time, the map they wanted to visit was ready, but a new module I'd added to Foundry (Map Coordinates) was causing problems loading large maps, including that one.  So they had to turn around before exploring that new level, and we also had to do the Arden Vul Ruins part (when the blue pillar teleported them to the surface) theater-of-the-mind since that map wouldn't load either.  I figured out the problem after the session was over and removed that module, so now they're clear to visit those maps again.

This session was fairly light on combat (just two one-sided fights against the single bat-worm and the four surprised Settite slavers) and loot (just that one tomb, plus the slavers' stuff and a few odd items they found in a cave), but the PCs explored a lot and rescued three more people from the Settites.


Achievements:
The Rescuers, for rescuing Harold and Hjalti and Kiglon, 1 XP

XP:
Exploration: 16 new locations, good for 1 XP
Loot: orange objects, slavers' gear, stuff from tomb, good for 1 XP
Achievements: 1 XP
Total:  3 XP


Next Week:


Will they go back down to one of the deeper levels that they've been foiled from visiting by technical issues, or will they stick to the surface ruins and try to figure out the Obelisks?  Will they find a new place to live that's more tolerant of live goats and dead giant beetles?  Will the Rugs of Instant Access demand a full share of loot and XP?

What Happened:

Michael and Vallium got matching letters from Wicktrimmer that the mule caravan from Narsileon with their items had arrived.  Michael also got a letter from his mother that his father was sick and he should come home.  They went to the Rarities Factor where Vallium picked up his new sword and Michael got his new scale armor, both already paid in advance.

Michael then made plans to leave.  His plan was to travel down the Imperial road to Newmarket, then all the way to Narsileon on the sea, then catch a ship down to Sweetwater Hold in southeastern Irthuin, then walk to his family's home from there.  He first settled up with the Right for Riches Company.  They agreed to give him a magic shield, a few healing potions, and the Belt of Strength as his share of party items.  Vael and Michael went to their lawyer's office and had him draw up a separation agreement to make it official; if Michael ever came back and rejoined the Right for Riches company it would be as a new member, with no claim to any pre-existing items.

Vael wanted to test the range of the Rugs of Instant Access, so he proposed that the group walk with Michael for a while, either until the Rugs stopped working or until they reached Narsileon.  (If they made it all the way to Narsileon with the Rugs still working, they would rent a place there and leave a Rug then teleport back, losing the tactical use of the Rugs but gaining instant access to a real city.)  It took a bit less than three days to hike the 60 miles to Newmarket.  On the fourth day, a bit south of Newmarket, the Rug stopped working.  They turned around and went back a bit and confirmed the Rug worked again; it appeared the range limit was about 60 miles.  At that point the Right for Riches company said goodbye to Michael and headed back north, and he resumed hiking south alone, at a noticeably faster speed.

It took three days to hike back to Gosterwick.  When they got there Uvash was still busy trying to convert Torunn the Smith to Zodarrim, but they'd just lost most of a week walking to Newmarket and back, so they went to the Grudge Brigade and hired Ashe the goblin.  They got up early the next morning and walked to Arden Vul, wanting to be there well before noon because the obelisks of the sun and moon said something about "midday life" and they interpreted that as "put the ankhs in the obelisks before noon".

At the base of the Long Stair, Vallium and Ioannes stepped through the Rug back to Gosterwick, while Vael and Ashe Levitated up the Cliff Face,with several bats flying as escorts.  They made it to the top safely, so Vael laid out the Rug and Vallium and Ioannes joined them.  Levitating rather than climbing the Long Stair saved about an hour, so they had a couple of hours left before noon.

The group walked over to the dam to leave tribute for Craas.  Vael noticed a scroll case on top of the dam.  Inside was a note from Craas, saying that the silver chess pieces were "appropriate tribute" but then listing several complaints, like the missing chess board, the pieces being the wrong colors, and the archons being larger than the dragons.  Everyone said some rude things about Craas, quietly, then Vael wrote a polite note back rather than risking dragon wrath.  They left a magic amulet that only worked for Settites as additional tribute.

Vael pointed out the Obelisk of the Stars.  The swamp between the dam and the obelisk looked wet and slow to traverse, so Vael cast Walk on Air on Vallium and Ioannes so they could get there faster.  There were a few ruined buildings near the swamp that people wanted to investigate, but they didn't want to risk taking too long so they only poked around for a couple of minutes, and didn't find anything.  When everyone reached the obelisk, they read the inscriptions and looked at the pictures of stars, then inserted one of the silver ankhs.  Nothing seemed to happen.

They noted a long intact building and discussed investigating it, but decided to do that later and finish with the obelisks first.  They went east toward a bridge, and spotted a large statue with the head missing.  They thought it was probably Vul the Sorcerer based on the resemblance to the Colossus of Vul on the Cliff Face, but couldn't be completely sure without the head.  They didn't see the head anywhere, and continued east across the bridge to the island in the middle of the Swift River, south of the Palace.  They went north to the palace wall, beyond which they had found the bottom part of the Obelisk of the Moon.  (The top part was nowhere to be seen.)  Vael grabbed an ankh from Vallium, Levitated over the wall, and put the ankh in the obelisk.  Again, nothing obvious happened.

They continued east over the other bridge and again saw the plinth with the feet and ankles of a large statue, but with the rest of the statue missing.  They compared the scale and thought that might be the statue of Arden whose head was above the door of the Inn of the Broken Head, but could not be completely sure.  (Vallium was keeping a list of large statue pieces and their locations in case they needed them in the future.)  They continued east to the Forum, went nowhere near the tower full of wraiths, went south to the Obelisk of the Sun, and discussed whether to insert the third ankh immediately or wait for noon.  They decided to insert it early then wait for noon, to avoid possibly inserting it too late.

Everyone watched the shadows to see when noon approached.  Vael Levitated up a bit to get a better view.  When the shadows disappeared, they heard a loud crashing sound to the northwest.  Vael impatiently flew over and was the first to notice a new hole in the ground, on the southern part of the island with the palace.  Looking into the hole, there were some stairs leading into the earth, ending at some large bronze doors.  Camilla the bat flew ahead and checked out the doors, magically relaying a picture of them back to Ashe.  The non-flying members of the party walked across a narrow iron footbridge to the island.  It didn't collapse under them, but Ashe decided not to send any summoned bears across it, just in case they were too heavy.

Everyone investigated the doors at the bottom of the stairs.  They were huge and bronze and sturdy looking and magical.  There were carvings of Thoth and Set (who everyone recognized) and Anubis and Horus (who Ioannes identified), all holding up their right hands in the universal sign for stop.  There was a big Mithric sign saying "Chamber of the Beacon.  Enter only with Permission of the Archon.  Speak the password to open.”  There were no obvious keyholes.  Vallium pushed on the door, but it was locked.  Everyone started guessing passwords, but only a couple of the party members spoke Mithric (which they assumed the password would be in), so they had to translate the others' guesses.  After a bunch of guesses that had no effect, Vael said "Open Sesame" in Mithric, and as soon as he said "open" in Mithric ("aperire") the door clicked unlocked.  (Apparently the ancient Archonteans were terrible at passwords.)

Vallium pushed the door open.  This revealed a large room, with a couple of statues in the back corners.  Angry statues, charging at him.  Vallium fought the two stone constructs, while two of Ashe's bat swarms and a summoned wild boar tried to help.  (Ashe's cave bears were too big for him to maintain down here where Nature's Sanctity was weak.)  The bats and boars didn't seem strong enough to penetrate the constructs' stone armor, and didn't even manage to distract them enough to soak any hits, but Vallium's enchanted broadsword worked fine.  He blocked and parried many punches from the constructs, and two sword cuts to each construct put them down.  Ioannes and Vael and Ashe stood in the back preparing to cast spells to help, but once Vallium downed the first construct they decided he had the fight under control and just watched from a few steps back.

The room had a bunch of frescoes on the walls in great condition, legionnaires and archons to the left, priests of Thoth and Set and Horus to the right.  There were wooden doors left and right, and a passage to a stone door straight ahead.  The group listened to the left door, heard nothing, and Vallium opened it.  Beyond was a workshop, with many benches, covered with tools and some odd devices.  The party spent a few minutes looking at the various devices, failed to really identify any of them, and started shoving them in their Bag of Holding.  They searched for secret doors but didn't find any.

They went across the room to the other wooden door, listened again, and opened it.  They found a rather luxurious reading room, full of nice furniture and bookshelves containing many books.  Three walls were decorated with images of Thoth, Set, and Horus.  Vael immediately started valuing the furniture and wondering which pieces they could carry through the Rug, but they didn't actually bother taking any furniture yet.  They did shove all the books in their Bag, though.  While they were taking books, a thin flat oval disc fell out of one.  It looked like the unexplained orange disc they had bought at the Goblin Market, but this one was pale green.  Once again they searched for secret doors, and this time Vael spotted an ibis fresco on the north wall that looked suspicious, with a slot in its beak.  He tried the small oval disc in the slot and it fit and the door opened.  Inside were a bunch more odd devices, including some that looked somewhat recognizable like a helmet and a shield, and others that were just weird.  Once again they put everything small enough to fit in their magic bag.

They searched for more secret doors, didn't find any, and went north to the stone door.  This one had a keyhole, but none of Vallium's keys fit.  Vael Lockmastered it open.  Beyond was a room with three more exits, all of them strange round doors with no obvious handles or keyholes.  Vallium remembered seeing one door like that before, behind the waterfall, but failing to open it.  (They had not had a wizard with them at the time, though.)  There was also a portable blackboard in the center of the room, covered with various writing in Mithric, some of it sensible, some of it just jumbled letters and numbers.  Vael pulled out pen and paper and copied everything from the board.

They then went west.  There was no obvious way to open the round door.  Vael held the pale green oval disc to it, and it opened, in slices like an iris.  Beyond was a small room, with a silver circle on the floor, and a gold square next to the circle on the wall.  They tried various combinations of holding things up to the circle and pushing the square and standing on the square, but nothing happened.  Nothing appeared magical either.  It was odd.

They went back to the east and opened the other iris door with the green oval.  It was the mirror image of the other room, with another silver disc and another gold square.  They once again tried a lot of things, but nothing happened.

Giving up on those rooms, they went north.  The green oval worked on that door too.  They went back and also tried the orange oval on all three doors, and it also worked.  To the north was a passage, with the east side collapsed, and the west side leading to another round door.  Against one wall were some wooden benches, a sign reading “The Beacon – Source of the Old Ones’ Power", and an arrow pointing west.

The green disk opened the western door too, and beyond it was a very confusing room.  It was all brilliantly lit with what appeared to be hidden Continual Light spells, but did not radiate magic.  The room contained 6 oversized chairs in various colors, fixed to the floor.  On the walls beyond some of the chairs were black mirrors, with odd switches and dials in front of them.  There were a couple of podiums with more such controls.  Finally there was an oval hole in the floor, with a little ridge around it.  It led down to another level beneath, but there was no ladder.

Ashe sent a bat down to scout the floor underneath, and didn't see anything that looked dangerous.  Vael sat in the central chair, which was way too big for him, and smoothly swiveled side to side on a pin.  It had cavities in both armrests, with a blinking red light in each, clearly magical but not detecting as such.  They tried putting various things in the cavities, but nothing seemed to have any effect.

Vael Levitated down through the hole in the floor, but something else interfered with his Levitation and pushed him down, then stopped him at the floor below.  Eventually the others followed him; there was some kind of levitation effect in the shaft that worked even without the spell, and was not detected as magic.  A passage northwest led to a round door straight ahead, with other doors left and right.  They chose left, for loot.

This door opened as they approached, without needing to hold up a disc.  Beyond was a room with many chairs in different colors around a long oval table.  On the table were three large sheets of parchment.  All of them had maps.  The first appeared to be a map of the two-level area they were in, with annotations by several rooms.  The rooms they hadn't visited yet were "power" and "strange ghost".  The second map was another two-level building, labeled "Barracks of the Old Ones" in Mithric.  The third map appeared to lead to some tomb, somewhere in the Halls.

They went to the room labeled "power" on the map.  It was full of a lot of odd machinery they did not recognize.  Vael somehow avoided pushing any buttons.  They went to the room labeled "strange ghost" on the map.  It led to a room with many small round tables surrounded by chairs.  There was also a bar along one wall with some kind of drink faucets.  And there was also indeed a strange ghost.

The translucent form was about 7' tall, with two arms and two legs, wearing an unfamiliar outfit.  It had brown skin, no hair, two small horns, and one less finger on each hand than expected.  As they approached, it greeted them in Mithric.  Vael and Ioannes, who spoke Mithric, engaged it in a long conversation, while Vallium and Ashe watched.

The ghostly creature was named Akla-Chah, and she was a Rudishva.  Sort of.  She was an illusion of a Rudishva.  Kind of.  She was a construct built by the Rudishva and appeared to them as an illusion of a Rudishva, because her job was talking to Rudishva and they were more comfortable talking to someone who looked like them.  But she was actually not a biological rudishva, but a construct.  But she considered herself a Rudishva anyway.

This did not really explain the situation, because they had no idea what a Rudishva was.  But she had a lot of questions and they answered them.  Their names, their species (she recognized Vallium and Ioannes as human but Vael looked somewhat different and Ashe looked very different), why not everyone spoke Mithric, what other languages they did speak, who they worked for, why no humans had come to visit in a long time, how they found the Beacon, their goals, who they worked for, etc.  It went on for a long time.  Akla-Chah was good at asking questions.  They eventually figured out that was her job -- she was a psychologist and morale officer for the Rudishva, whoever they were.  Her projection only worked in this room, so could not leave, but she said her actual form was somewhere else.

The short version was that the Beacon was a Rudishva vehicle that had crashed into Arden Vul many years ago and had been unable to leave.  The surviving Rudishva (and their allies, the Varumani and Varuda) survived here, trying to find a way home.  But then some horrible treason happened and most of them were killed and it was too painful to get into details.  Later the ancient Archonteans had come to Arden Vul and discovered this piece of the Beacon and rudely interrogated Akla-Chah, but eventually they stopped coming and she didn't know why.

Also, this room was a cafeteria, and they were welcome to food and drink from the machines along one wall.  Vael pushed the food button and got an Arden Vul cake (very filling and nutritious, but not that tasty) like the ones they had once seen in the market in Gosterwick.  Ioannes pushed the drink button and got some very strong alcohol, stronger than any of them had tasted before.  It was too strong for him, but some of the others liked it better, and Akla-Chah said they were free to take some to go, so they filled a canteen and a couple of wineskins.

Vael pulled out some of the artifacts they had found earlier, and Akla-Chah identified a few as possibly weapons but was not too sure, as she was a talker not a fighter, and had only seen pictures of such weapons in Rudishva entertainment media, er, moving books, that might not be accurate.  She did identify the ovals as keycards that controlled access to doors, and said that the different colors of cards were for different people with different ranks and access levels, and that some of the cards were of colors she had not seen before and might be fakes.  Vael asked what the best color was, and Akla-Chah said the captain's card was gold.  They asked where the captain was, and Akla-Chah said that Captain Leil-Jor was killed in the treason, and she didn't know where her body was.  Vael asked if there were any other constructs like her, and Akla-Chah said there was one other, but he went crazy and they should avoid him.

After they ran out of questions, the party left Akha-Chah, but said they'd be back soon.  They tested that they could open the secret door from both sides, left one of the Rugs inside the secret door, then went outside.  Vael flew to all three obelisks and pulled out the ankhs.  This did not cause the steel doors over the stairwell to re-close.  Much investigation of the steel doors did not reveal an easy way to close them.  They were not directly magical, and it they appeared to weigh many tons, more than Vallium's strength or Vael's Apportation spell could lift.  Maybe they could lift them with a large team of oxen or a dwarven engineering team or a dragon, but they wanted to cover the stairs quickly before anyone else spotted them.  So they decided to instead build a cover over the stairwell.

Vael and Ashe cast Shape Earth many times (so each casting would use a manageable amount of mana) to create essentially a bridge of stone logs above the stairway.  They then used more Shape Earth spells to close the gaps between the pieces, and finally Ashe threw a bunch of dirt and sticks on top of the stone to try to camouflage the cover.  They completely sealed it up, leaving no hole to get in or out, so they'd need another Shape Earth (or stone-cutting tools and time) to get back in.  But with the Rug inside, they could also just teleport in from Gosterwick.

With their tracks covered, they went over to the nearby lake to look for treasure.  Ashe used Water Vision and reported a wrecked barge on the bottom about 50 feet down.  Also a huge turtle and a bunch of big crocodiles.  They formulated a plan to search the barge.  Vallium, wearing the Ring of Free Action to let him move through water quickly, would get Breathe Water and Water Vision spells from Ashe and Flight and Mage Sight from Vael.  He would then fly above the wreck, dive down into it, and look for treasure.

Unfortunately, the huge turtle was staying near the wreck, looking up at Vallium.  Vallium wasn't in the mood to be eaten by the turtle, so he flew over and conferred with Ashe.  Ashe summoned two hammerhead sharks, large but not as large as the turtle.  They swam over toward the turtle, who saw interesting prey and gave chase.  The sharks, who were faster than the turtle, led the turtle toward the northwest corner of the lake.  This gave Vallium an opening, and he flew down through the water to the wreck.  Inside were two fairly rotten wooden chests.  He punched holes through the rotted wood of the first.  It was full of small ancient silver pennies and the large ancient gold solidi.  He grabbed all the gold he could, stuffing it quickly into his bag, then went over to the second chest, which was much larger.  It had a mix of items: a few gold medallions, some more silver ankhs, a magic bastard sword, a magic wand, a huge magic gold key, and three regular-sized keys.  Vallium got really excited about all the keys, but remembered to also take the other stuff.  He decided he had enough time to go back to the first chest and grab the silver coins, then flew straight up out of the water.  The turtle was still busy chasing sharks, so he went back toward shore, where Vael and Ashe were each focused on maintaining several spells while Ioannes was checking for danger and asking to see if either needed more mana.

Once Vallium reached the shore, they dropped all the spells (to the disappointment of the hungry turtle who really wanted shark), rested a bit, then walked back to Gosterwick.  They had a bag full of treasure and a story nobody would believe.  


GM's Comments:

It took them 31 delves, but they finally found what appears to be definitive proof that extraterrestrials visited Magae.  They also thought to look in the lake that they've walked next to dozens of times, and were rewarded with some treasure.


Achievements:

First Contact in a While: 1 XP for meeting Akla-Chah.


XP:
Exploration:  18 new locations, good for 1 XP.
Loot: They kept the books and Rudishva artifacts, but the treasure from the lake was worth 2 XP.
Achievements: 1 XP
Total: 4 XP

Next week:

They're currently planning to explore an unexplored bit of the Great Cavern, then go way down the stairs from the Set level to the Arden level behind the waterfall, and see if the keycards from the Beacon also work on the round door they found there.

What Happened:

Vael spent most of the week learning some spoken Rudishva from Akha-Chah, while she learned some spoken Archontean from Vael.  (They started with Mithric in common.)  By the end of the week Vael knew quite a few Rudishva words and phrases but still had a lot of grammar and vocabulary to learn.  Meanwhile, Akla-Chah was speaking Archontean fairly fluently, but with a disturbingly Vael-like inflection.

Uvash spent most of the week reading the Rudishva Devices book and taking careful notes, but did not yet quite trust himself to start experimenting with the Rudishva artifacts.  He urged his companions to also study the book so that they could compare notes and start devising a plan to experiment, but none of the others shared his Dwarven fascination with the technology.

Ioannes and Vallium spent most of the week back in Gosterwick, researching and brewing potions and carousing.  Vallium sadly found that, despite his willingness to buy drinks, nobody was sharing much new information with him, and actually noticed an elf writing down everything he said.

On Lunday, they all teleported back to the Beacon using the Rugs of Instant Access, along with the mercenary archer Lacrymosa.  Vael cast Shape Earth to punch a small hole in the stone cover he and Ashe had built over the stairway to the surface.  Everyone climbed through the hole into the rainy early morning chill.  Vael cast another Shape Earth to repair the hole in the cover.  They all hiked southeast through the gates of the ruins, to the top of the Long Stair.  There Vael spread the Rug on the ground and the others all used to to teleport back to Gosterwick.  Vael grabbed the Rug and Levitated down the side of the Cliff Face to the secret door, then spread out the Rug and waited for the others to join him.  They then opened the secret door, and Vallium led them in a roundabout march through the southern Great Cavern, east then north they west through side passages, the across the Cavern itself to under the ledge in the southeast corner.  At that point everyone stepped back through the Rug, Vael carried it to the top of the ledge, and everyone came back out.

There was a short passage back into the cave wall, terminating in a 4' high bas-relief of a mostly realistic face of a middle aged man, except with half-spherical empty holes where his eyes should be.  A careful inspection of the face showed that it was magical, and that there were lines around the edges as if it were a door, but it would not open.  Vallium compared the eye holes to various small objects he was carrying, then stepped back through the Rug to the Arcane Practitioners Club in Gosterwick and came back with a pouch full of additional coins and gems, and compared each of them to the eye holes without actually inserting them.  The eyes were too spherical and deep for coins, and too perfectly round to be a good match for most gems, but the silver and blue magical eyes they had were a perfect match.  Vallium said those eyes were valuable and he didn't want to risk losing them without knowing more, so he recommended not actually inserting them yet.  They resolved to come back later when they learned more.

Everyone stepped back through the Rug, and Vael flew it over to the Set landing, then everyone came back out to investigate.  The Settites were still gone.  The group went west, then north, then down a stairway to the west.  Vallium carefully crept ahead in case there were more guards in the octagonal room, but it was empty.  He led them west to the blue pillar, then north from there to a very long staircase down.

The stairs debouched into a room on the Arden level, containing a large construct with the face of Arden and two large hammers, and a large number of corpses of various ages and types but with similar large hammer dents.  Vallium held up his platinum token of Arden.  The construct watched him but did not attack or say anything.  Vallium went to the door in the south of the room, which had previously been deformed with a Shape Earth spell to the point where it was now a crawlway.  He inserted the token into the slot in the door, then crawled through the hole.  The construct appeared satisfied by the ritutal of inserting the token and let him and his companions pass.

Vallium led the group south and east and north around some descending and turning stairs, then north past the large Continually Lit chamber dedicated to Arden, then east past the room with the hot bath, then north over a small barricade with a lot of old corpses, then finally east to the room with 19 beautiful statues of Archontean worthies, and one destroyed statue.  From there a hole in the wall led to a rough narrow passage heading south.  Vallium led the company past a stairway leading up to the west, past some side passages, into a Rudishva-looking passage with while marble floors and walls.  The floor was scorched and bent as though someone had set off a huge fireball here.  There was a circular door at the end of the passage, which Vallium wanted to try opening with the Rudishva oval cards.

While he advanced to try the door, a couple of the earth elementals they had encountered before somehow snuck up behind the group and attacked Ioannes and Vael in the back.  Lacrymosa was caught off guard and took a second to recover her wits.  Meanwhile, Ioannes and Vael each took a couple of heavy blows from stone hands.  Neither quite went down though.  Uvash spun and cast a Stop Bleeding spell on the injured Vael, as Vael activated Larel's Cloak to become invisible then hid against the wall.  Ioannes dove forward away from the elementals to hide behind Uvash, as Vallium heard the commotion behind him and ran toward it.  The second elemental tried to tackle Lacrymosa from behind but completely missed and ended up prone on the ground.  Lacrymosa recovered her senses and started putting arrows into the two elementals at high speed, one in the neck, then the other in the foot to ground it then the neck to try to kill it.  Surprisingly, both elementals disappeared into thin air, just as Vael had.  Lacrymosa started firing arrows into likely hiding spots while Vallium ran up and started poking around with his sword, but neither found the elementals.  Vael invisibly nudged Ioannes while identifying himself and asking for some healing.  Ioannes healed Vael and Lacrymosa, Uvash healed Ioannes, and then Lacrymosa advocated finding and killing the elementals before they got away.

First, they decided to spend a few seconds trying to open the door.  None of the large pile of variously colored Rudishva oval key cards they had opened it.  Vael tried a Lockmaster spell, which gave him a bewildering vision of something that was Not A Lock As He Knew Locks.

Giving up on the round door, the group went into the passages to the east looking for the elementals.  They traversed several caverns full of stalactities and stalagmites but saw no sign of the creatures.  Vallium failed to watch his step while peering around a corner looking for danger, and slipped into a pool of water.  With the Ring of Free Action causing him to easily slip through the water, he immediately sunk quite a distance, before righting himself and kicking and reaching the surface.  After telling the others to watch their step, Vallium dove back into the water, while Vael flew around above it.  The sinkhole was about 60' deep, and at the bottom was a fairly rotten and party eaten Rudishva corpse, wearing a mostly intact orange one-piece outfit with articulated arms and legs.  Vallium hauled the body to the surface, then searched it, finding another rust-colored keycard.  Already wet, he decided to make a second dive into the cold water and look for anything else down there, but didn't find anything else.  He surfaced, considered putting the body through the Rug, decided that might annoy the landlords, and put it in the Bag of Holding instead.

They continued exploring the twisting passages, finding no sign of the elementals, but finding two tunnels sloping down, to the north and east.  They took the eastern one and ended up on top of a ledge, covered with large spider webs.  Carefully cutting some webs away, they advanced and saw below them another large cavern full of giant mushrooms.  Vael again had everyone else step through the Rug so he could Levitate down to the cavern floor.  However, they had not noticed a phase spider on the ceiling above them.  As Vael's last companion disppeared into the carpet, the spider decided the odds were in its favor, and pounced on Vael.  Fortunately for Vael, he saw it dropping toward him, and cast Blink to put himself out of reach, several yards out from the ledge.  Also fortunately, he had a Levitation spell on, so this did not cause a painful fall.  The spider looked at Vael, while shaking its hindquarters back and forth like a cat waiting to pounce, but decided the fall was too far.  Vael charged up a lightning spell and threw it at the spider.  The spider phased out of existence to dodge the bolt.  Vael flew away from the ledge, spent a while avoiding any walls or ceilings or the floor in case the spider was there, then eventually decided it was safe to drop the Rug and open it up with an Apportation spell.  A minute later, Vallium stepped through the Rug, followed quickly by the others.  Vael explained the spider attack, but it did not reappear.

They explored the fungal forest, while Ioannes tried to identify mushrooms.  He saw some Aqua Vitae, and some big red mushrooms that might be fatal Red Veil or might be valuable Red Lotus, but since he wasn't sure he recommended not touching them.  They walked northwest to the edge of the cave and spotted some ledges beyond, then went northeast until they spotted a pond.  An island in the center of the pond contained a building, some kind of automated shovels, and a varumani trying to fix something.  Vael tried talking to the Varumani, but either he wasn't friendly or didn't speak Archontean or Mithric or Elvish or any of Vael's several words of Rudishva.  Ioannes cast Gift of Tongues on Vael, and then Vael started speaking Varumani, and the Varumani responded.  He was a miner, this area was Varumani territory, there were some nasty blood eels in the water so they should not go in.  Vael asked where the rest of Varumani territory was, and the Varumani said north.  Vael asked if there was anything dangerous that way, and the Varumani said "teenagers."  The spell ran out and the group headed north.

As they advanced past a large rock formation, some boulders rolled down it in their direction.  They were moving slowly enough to easily dodge.  Vael spotted a couple of varumani on top of the formation, and used a Thunderclap spell to announce his displeasure.  This was unexpectedly effective, as both varumani retreated to the other side of the rock formation and kept it between themselves and the group.  The cavern ended with a cliff at the north edge, with a ledge on top.  Vael flew up, saw a paved path and a round door, then flew back down and had everyone step through the Rug, then flew back up with the Rug and let them step back out.

Before anyone tried the round door, Ioannes started poking around on the north wall and spotted a secret door.  Vael came up and explained that, no, that's not a secret door, that's just a totally normal natural crack in a wall, Ioannes responded by opening the secret door.  Beyond was a short passage, leading to a worked but decaying room.  In the room were several humans, some dressed like wizards and others like warriors.  One of the wizards blustered that "you're not allowed to be here go away."  The Right for Riches company declined.  One of the warriors called for reinforcements, and a couple more warriors and another wizard came into the room from a passage to the west.  Now outnumbered, the Right for Riches company refused to leave and kept asking questions.  The lead wizard decided not to fight, and not to talk further, and led his group back down the passage to the west, but warned them not to follow.

The room contained a small niche on the west wall with a 4' tall statue of a strange 6-armed creature.  Vallium tried lifting the statue, and it was heavy, but he was strong enough to move it a short distance.  He had Vael spread the Rug on the floor, then picked up the statue, stepped onto the Rug, and said the command word to teleport with it back to their apartment, then returned.  While he was filching the statue, the others searched the room for secret doors, and found one on the east wall.  Using the rule "secret doors first" (which is somehow related to "left for loot") they went through.  It led to some stairs up, and ended in a narrow corridor, with a door on the east end and another on the south wall.  The eastern door had a bunch of graffiti on it in a language they didn't know.  Vallium listened at the east door and heard nothing, then at the south door and heard conversation in Archontean.

Vael knocked on the south door.  It opened a minute later, and there were several humans inside, again dressed as a mix of wizards and warriors.  The Right for Riches company identified themselves.  The strangers asked if King Weskenim sent them.  Vael said they knew King Wiskenim, they were friends with King Wiskenim, but they were not currently representing him.  The strangers said they were awaiting an audience with the King.  The company left.  Vael wrote down all the graffiti on the east door, then knocked on the south door, and asked the wizard if he could read it.  The wizard explained that it was in goblin and that it said "danger," "keep out," "death within," etc.  Vael asked if they knew how to get from here to the King, and the wizard pointed at the ceiling and said the hole there led to the goblin halls, if they could Levitate or climb.

Leaving the mysterious strangers again, the party decided not to open the eastern door, but explored the hallway all the way to the west, where it had collapsed.  They saw a skeleton poking out from the rubble, so dug it out.  The skeleton had been stripped of all equipment, but there was a magic spear behind it, which they took.

They went back to the hole in the ceiling.  Vael Levitated up through it, and saw a small passage leading north, to a huge cave with a lot of noise and the smell of goblins and goats.  When he moved forward to check it out, he saw two ogre guards flanking the end of the passage.  One looked at him and said "Halfling Slayer, you may pass."  Vael went back for the others, and they used a rope to climb up to the hole, then emerged into the Goblin Great Hall.

Vallium walked over to the Merchant's Corner in the southeast of the Hall, and introduced himself to Temrin, the goblin artist sitting waiting for customers.  He asked what Temrin painted, and Temrin said he mostly did portraits, but pointed at Vallium's Halfling Slayer patch and said that he'd made those for the King.  Vallium said Termin's work was excellent and asked if he could paint a portrait of their group.  Temrin agreed, and Vallium then used his Ring of Change Self to appear to be Michael and asked Temrin to add Michael to the portrait.  After about an hour, the portrait was finished, and Vallium purchased it.  He complimented the work and asked if Temrin had any other art for sale.  Temrin had a portrait of King Weskenim and another of Gribble, both of which Vallium also purchased.  He asked what else Temrin could draw, and Temrin said he could do maps and sometimes they turned out to actually lead to the object, but sometimes they didn't.  This got Vallium's attention so he asked Temrin to draw him a map to a necklace with "Nyema" on it.  Temrin started drawing and said it should be ready tomorrow. Vael cast Seeker looking for Nyema's necklace and saw a vision of a necklace hanging on a hook on a wall, somewhere down and to the east.  Vallium paid him for all of the art and said they would be back for the map.

Meanwhile Uvash spotted a group of dwarves, accompanied by a war dog, buying provisions from another merchant.  The dwarves were the Survivors of the Stone, an adventuring party, looking for "something of ours but I can't say what."  Their dog was named Ummchark, which meant "chisel" in Dwarvish.  Vael tried petting the dog without asking and almost became a chew toy, but its owner Ljot called the dog off and told it to go stand next to a goat and not eat it either.  Uvash mentioned they had found a life-stone and asked if any of the dwarves knew the Corundum clan, but they did not.  One of the dwarves, Hallsted, another cleric of Zodarrim, said that he would be happy to take the life-stone back to Kazildor if they finished their mission and headed back that way before Uvash did.  He would look for Uvash at the House of the Gods in Gosterwick before they left the area.

Another merchant, an arms dealer named Claudine, had been watching the interactions.  Vael went over to check on her weapons, but was not impressed with any of them.  Claudine was equally not impressed with Vael.  Vallium also came over to look, and Claudine liked his scale armor and magic sword, but he didn't see anything he wanted to buy either.

The group left the merchants and headed up the spiral stairs to the northeast, past Rizzit the weird purple wax demon, and around the upper level of Goblintown toward King Weskenim's rooms.  When they reached the Court, the major-domo Palestrim recognized them and asked what they wanted.  Vael indicated they would like to see the King.  Palestrim asked if they had news of the Scepter of the Goblins, and Vael said not yet.  It took most of an hour to get their audience, then the king deigned to speak to them for a few minutes.  He said they were doing great work, but he needed that Scepter to unify the goblins.  Vael asked about the secretive wizards, and Weskenim said he was letting them wait in that out-of-the-way room rather than granting an audience, as he thought they were opposed to the Varumani and he didn't really want to make any powerful enemies right now.  He wasn't granting or refusing an audience, just stalling and hoping they went away.  Lacrymosa mentioned that she'd been part of the Great Reconquest of Upper Goblintown but had never received her patch, so Weskenim instructed Palestrim to find her patch, and Palestrim found it in a drawer somewhere so the king could pin it on her and recognize her as an official Halfling Slayer.

With their audience finished, the group went back down the stairs to the Goblin Great Hall, then back down the hole to the southern corridor, then down the secret stairs to the Varumani level.  They followed a passage north, and found a guard room with four varumani guards.  The guards asked if they had varumani passports.  They did not have passports.  The guard said they could not enter varumani territory without a passport.  Vael asked where to get one, and the guard was not very helpful, except for allowing them to leave.  Behind the guards in the room were some small creatures resembling a cross between monkeys and bats, who did not talk, but chirped.

They went back south, then went east to the round door.  Vallium's brown ID did not open it, but Vael's orange ID did.  Beyond was a hallway with two huge stone thrones with leather throws over the backs.  One of the seats had a Rusishva-looking glyph; the other was damaged as though the glyph had been destroyed.  Vael wrote down the glyph on a piece of paper for later investigation.  They continued to the end of the hall, where there was an octagonal room full of trash, and some wide stairs up.

The stairs led to another large corridor, containing a bar run by a varumani and 3 goblins.  Vael purchased a Hak's Special Red Ale.  Ioannes purchased a mushroom cake and got a free cup of water.  The varumani was named Hal, and spoke pretty good Archontean.  He said this was the Arena level and on match days this bar did great business, but it was pretty quiet right now.  There was another set of stairs up to the east, and a chasm to the west with a makeshift bridge going southwest.  Vael asked Hal if that chasm was The Great Chasm, and Hal said he didn't go into the chasm because it wasn't safe, but he'd heard they were connected.

After finishing their snack, the group headed north.  They spied some more large and creepy stone chairs, then some guard niches full of human arena guards, then a room with some gamblers loitering.  Vael spoke to a colorfully dressed varumani tout named Keth, who said tomorrow's matchups were not announced yet so odds were not yet posted, but they were hoping the announcement would come soon.  West of the gamblers were some bleachers overlooking the a huge arena with a sandy floor, currently empty.  There was a door to the northwest, which someone tried opening, but a guard ran out and said "that's private don't go in there" then said something to another guard about how stupid people were about not knowing where not to go.  The second guard said something about maybe putting up helpful signs, and the first guard said something about signs not working because stupid people couldn't read, as the group pretended not to hear the guards and walked away north.

They passed some kind of tunnel bored into the east wall, then reached a fancy throne to the north.  The throne was unoccupied, but some familiar adventurers were hanging in punishment stocks near the throne.  It was Dalton's Darlings, the entire group, including their friend Jost who they had rescued from Gerrilad's jail.  Dalton revealed that they had fought in an arena battle the day before, and the rules were no magic, so they had obeyed by not even bringing their wizard to the fight since he was useless without spells.  But unfortunately Isidor the halfling got injured and reflexively fast-drew and chugged a healing potion, and healing potions were considered magic, so the Arena Lord had stopped the bout, ruled that Dalton's Darlings were cheating, awarded the win to the goblins they were fighting, and ruled that since it was a first offence and they were stupid surfacers who didn't know anything, Dalton's Darlings could spend a few days in the stocks rather than being immediately executed.  The Right for Riches company started asking Dalton more questions, but an arena guard walked up and said "no talking to the prisoners" so they left.

They continued west down a wide passage, past a statue of a four-armed monster and a statue of a Rudishva (who welcomed visitors to the Arena in Archontean, Varumani, and Rudishva), past some magical darkness, and finally west to the Great Chasm, where they saw a huge contraption operated by one varumani in charge and two varumani laborers turning the winch, the Troll Lifts.  The lead varumani said it cost one silver per leg, since there were five of them and they each had two legs, that would be ten silver.  From here they could go up, or across the Chasm, where there was another lift that went down.  They paid the ten silver to go up.  They got in the cage, and the two varumani turned the winch and hoisted them up a long way, until they arrived a level up.  There they met another crew of a varumani overseer and two winch pullers, who let them out of the cage.  Nearby they saw a bridge across the Chasm, with a gap in the middle, and some wooden planks across the gap.

Recognizing about where they were, Vael cast Seek Earth looking for platinum and sensed some nearby, in the varumani lift operators' camp.  Not wanting conflict with them, he tried again, and found more platinum further north somewhere out of sight.  They crossed the bridge and Vael cast Seek Earth for both gold and platinum, and sensed platinum north and gold south.  Giving up for now, they went southwest and found Killick and his large group of goblins.  Killik greeted them and allowed safe passage through his territory to Gog's cave.  Gog greeted them, hoping they'd brought him food, and was disappointed they had not.  He still allowed them through his cave to the secret door leading to stairs up to Upper Goblintown.  The party went up the stairs, through Upper Goblintown, up the stairs through the Pyramid of Thoth, and then back across the surface ruins of Arden Vul to the Beacon.  There Vael asked everyone to step through the Rug, then experimented with Blinking through the cover over their stairs, to the Beacon, rather than using Shape Earth to dig a hole.  He succeeded, and was through with less work.  He laid the Rug down in the Beacon so the others could come through.


GM's Comments:


They failed to open either of the doors they wanted to open, got ambushed twice, and only found a few items of loot.  Yet this was a very successful session in terms of exploration.  They survived both ambushes, explored a whole lot of rooms, found two Arden Vul Iconic Locatons, and visited two previously unvisited levels.


XP:
Exploration: 35 new locations (a new record), good for 2 XP
Loot: not much, but the magic spear is worth enough to generate 1 XP if sold
Achievements: Two Arden Vul Iconic Locations, the Arena and the Sundered Span, for 2 XP
Total: 5 XP

Next Week:

The current plan is to bring food to Gog and see if he can tell them how to get Varumani Passports.  They would then return to Goblintown and get their map from Temrin, and follow it and see if it takes them to Nyema's necklace.  If so, they would recover it and bring it to Yrtol.  If not, they would improvise.

# DFRPG Arden Vul Session 4: Cheese and Crackers and Thoth and Demons

Date:

Demmasday, 5th of Lucrios, 2993 AEP


Weather:

Cool, overcast, rainy


Player Characters:

Ioannes Grammatikos Byzantios, Archontean cleric of Demma (Demented Avenger)
Michael J Dundee, Thorcin barbarian (Adam)
Vael Sunshadow, Half-Elven mage (Kyle)
Vallium Halcyon, Archontean fighter (Greybrown)
Lacrymosa Merenuithiel Armaris, Elven archer (mercenary) (Archon Shiva)


Significant NPCs:


3 small ball-shaped demons
2 Ibis-headed gargoyles
About 6 small flying jellyfish
3 groups of beastmen
Dog-headed beastman sergeant
Voice of Thoth, one of the Twelve ancient greater gods
Alleged huge ball-shaped demon
Roskelly Winterleaf, halfling underground toll collector lieutenant
Several halfling toll collectors


While in Gosterwick, Vallium visited the Baliff's Truncheon tavern and bought a lot of shady-looking people drinks attempting to find information about the halfling Phlebotomas Plumthorn, but didn't hear anything he thought was truthful and useful.  Ioannes researched the Krakteros clan, whose sigil they saw on a tomb, but didn't find anything beyond them being one of the Empire's Five Families, with much wealth and power, mostly back at the capital Archontos.  Vael bought a lock to help keep the dam secure for the green dragon Craastonistorex, and commissioned some high quality robes at Tasha's Tailor Shop.  Uvash was still tied up in intense theological debate at the House of Gods, so the group decided to hire the mercenary on call at the Grudge Brigade, a female elven archer named Merenuithiel.

Very early Demmasday morning, Vallium bought three sweetrolls wrapped for travel from Matrona the baker.  The group hiked to the cliff face without significant incident.  Vael Levitated himself up the Long Stair (and rolled a critical success, for faster than normal movement), while the others hiked up the slippery wet trail.  At one narrow treacherous bit about two-thirds of the way up, Ioannes slipped and almost went over the edge, but Vallium caught him and pulled him up.

Arriving at the ruins of Arden Vul, the group debated about where to go, then decided to first visit the dam and install the new lock, to keep the dragon happy.  They made it there without any problem and the lock seemed to hold the door reasonably well.  Vael kept one key and gave the other to Michael.

Next they discussed exploring the ruins, but decided to go back to the Pyramid of Thoth.  But then they took a small detour to look down the Well of Light and see if anyone had undone their cleaning of the mirror at the bottom.  It was a rainy day, but less light than before seemed to be reflecting.  They dropped a Continual Light rock down into the Well and confirmed that the large mirror at the bottom wasn't reflecting the light, so it was again covered with some kind of dirt or debris.

The group climbed the pyramid and discussed which door to take.  Merenuithiel had brought some spikes, so they decided to manipulate the pyramid's arms into the straight-up position to open the second, scarier entrance, with corpses and no handle to open the door from inside, then try to spike the door open.  The spikes seemed to hold, so they went down.  There was much less graffiti in this passage than the first one, but someone had drawn a scorpion in chalk and written "Where is it?" in Archontean underneath.

Vallium led the way down the next staircase, which ended in a small room with a door on the far wall.  As he stpped into the room, a pit trap opened underneath him.  Vallium almost fell in, but caught the edge and pulled himself up.  The pit was only about 5' square, but it was 25' deep, enough to seriously injure or even kill someone who fell in.  And the bottom of the pit was full of bones.

Vallium went around the pit and tried to open the door, but it would not budge.  Everyone searched and found no way of opening the door, or evidence of space on the other side; it appeared to be a false door.

With no other exit available, Vael levitated down into the pit, and found many bones and the glint of a few coins.  He came back up and cast Levitate on Ioannes as well, to have help searching.  While they were digging around in the bones looking for treasure, a small ball-shaped demon that was mostly teeth popped into the pit through a previously unseen entrance in the east wall, and tried to bite Vael.  Vael used his Luck to successfully dodge, and then Levitated himself and Ioannes straight up.  The small demon snapped at their heels, but wasn't tall enough to reach.  Once she had a clear line of sight, Merenuithiel filled it with arrows from the top edge of the pit above.

After resting for a few minutes at the top, Vael Levitated everyone but Merenuithiel down into the pit, two at a time, while Merenuithiel kept watch at the top.  They saw the small secret door the demon had came through led into a small room with a 5' high ceiling.  The room contained a small scary void of magical blackness, a magical bust of a woman Ioannes thought was the goddess Selket with a scorpion on her head, and a few scattered items on the floor. The items included what looked like a couple of magic rings, a couple of magic gems, and a magic wand, which were enough to make everyone overcome their caution and enter the room.  While they were picking up loot, two more of the small spherical biting demons came through the black gate.  Vallium and Michael, who were waiting for something like that to happen, surrounded and killed one.  The last surviving demon, heavily wounded, jumped back into the black gate and disappeared.  Nobody followed it into the gate.

After all the obvious portable loot had been picked up, the group discussed the bust with the scorpion on its head.  Eventually Michael touched the scorpion and disappeared.  The rest of the group talked about what to do for a minute, then Vael Levitated Merenuithiel down, and they all grabbed the scorpion together.  They all teleported to the same place as Michael, a huge room they had briefly stuck their heads into previously, the Great Hall, in beastman territory.  The room was big enough that they couldn't see the ceiling or the south or east walls with their Continual Light, but they saw several knocked-down columns, and scorch marks on the floor indicating some kind of magical battle.  Vael and Merenuithiel were both exhausted (from spellcasting and firing a bow way too big for her, respectively) and sat down to rest.  After a few minutes of rest, a flying stone gargoyle with the head of an ibis swooped down to attack.  Michael heard it coming and yelled a warning.  Merenuithiel failed to dodge the attack clumsily enough that she fell down as the gargoyle slightly wounded her, but fatally shot the gargoyle while lying on her back. A second ibis-headed gargoyle swooped down, and Merenuithiel shot that one too, without having time to stand up first.  She was very tired, on the verge of passing out, so Ioannes cast Lend Energy.  Everyone then left the room through an open pair of doors to the west, looking for a more secure resting place.

They passed the same beastman guard post they saw last week, and made some excuses through an arrow slit about having hit a teleport trap.  They went north (but not all the way out of beastman territory) and were resting in the hallway when a patrol of beastmen came to check on them, said they were trespassing, listened to the story about the teleport trap again, and decided not to attack them.  Vael again tried to parley with the beastmen about other matters, and the beastman sergeant said he did not have authority to conduct negotiations but would ask his Count.  The sergeant asked for the group's name, and they didn't have one and Vael made some comment about cheese and crackers, so the sergeant said "okay, Cheese and Crackers, I will tell my Count that you would like to parley.  Announce yourself loudly next time before entering our territory."  Vallium gave the sergeant a sweetroll.

They went north to the room with the makeshift wooden barricade that used to have a spear with a halfling head on it, then tried a previously unexplored door to the east.  It led to a room with another group of beastmen.  They party apologized for making a wrong turn and went north over the barricade into known non-beastman territory.

They went north into the gray-green mist, past the two competing Magic Mouths, then east to a room with a gross sludgy pool that might be the source of the mist.  Ioannes threw a rock in, but nobody wanted to enter the pool or drink the black water.  They proceeded east to a room that looked like a chapel to Thoth, with some benches and a magical onyx pillar and some Mithric writing high up on the wall, obscured by grime.  Vael Levitated up, cleaned it, and saw that it said "Thou May Ask of Thoth What Thou Will, Provided Thou Accept His Judgment."  Ioannes grabbed the onyx pillar and asked Thoth the correct method of making an offering to His statue.  Thoth actually answered, both with a strong electric shock through the pillar that burned but did not quite stun Ioannes, and also by saying in a booming voice that one must loudly invoke Thoth's name while putting the gift of knowledge into the offering chest.

Ioannes tried casting Minor Healing on himself, failed, and didn't try again with the penalty.  Vael gave him some best effort First Aid, which didn't do much but made him feel a bit less singed.  The group continued down the passage to the east and found another room, with no other exits but a lot of trash on the floor.  Sifting through the trash for valuables, Vael found a magical 8" x 8" x 1/2" square of white glass on the floor.  Vallium wrapped it up in a blanket for protection and put it in his pack.

Vael suggested searching for secret doors, and eventually found one in the southeast corner.  Vallium eventually figured out how to open it, by sliding a wall panel sideways, and it led to a narrow corridor, which went south about 50' to a dead end.  Michael found a matching secret door at the other end of the corridor and opened it, into a large room with several gold-painted columns and a mixed group of corpses (human, halfling, and beastman) on the floor.  As the group emerged from the secret passage to search the bodies, several small creatures that looked like jellyfish flew slowly at them.  Everyone piled back into the secret passage for cover, while Merenuithiel threw a Concussion spell into the room, stunning the 3 nearest jellyfish.  While the jellyfish were stunned, Vallium chopped one in half with his sword, and Merenuithiel filled two others with arrows.  The other jellyfish fled the room to the east.

The group looted the bodies, then saw that there were two exits east and a door west.  The door was back toward what Ioannes thought was beastman territory, so they chose east, and took the left passage because "left for loot."  They saw two heavy-looking stone doors to the north, but continued east past them.  The passage turned north and then reached a room with a big stone chair, facing a chasm wider, higher, and deeper than their Continual Light reached.  The chair had a glyph on the seat, which nobody recognized.

Ioannes eventually sat in the chair, and saw a demon.  It was the same ball shape as the small demons they had fought in the Pit of Bones inside the Pyramid of Thoth, but much, much bigger.  Terrified, he started running.  Luckily, he ran away from the chasm rather than into it.  He wasn't very fast, so Vael chased him down and held onto him.  Ioannes didn't calm down, but he wasn't quite freaked out enough to attack his friends, so the group detailed one of the large fighters to keep hold of him for the rest of the mission.  Ioannes agreed that was a good idea to give him a bodyguard, as long as everyone else also watched for the demon.

Vael decided to explore the chasm a bit.  He Levitated far enough across to see there was another room on the far side of the chasm, but didn't enter it.  He saw that it went up and down past the range of his light, and didn't see any sunlight above.  He flew up about 30 yards and still didn't see an exit, then flew back down to the group.  The chasm was definitely big, but they weren't sure exactly how big yet.  They decided to defer further exploration of the chasm until Ioannes was in better shape.

They doubled back to the west, to the two stone doors, and decided to open the west one, again using the "left for loot" axiom.  It was too heavy for Vallium to open, so Michael helped, and eventually they managed to open it.  Inside was a long straight hallway full of about 20 bodies in various stages of decay, some with obvious loot.  Vael and Vallium started dragging bodies and loot out, while Michael kept watch on Ioannes, and Merenuithiel helped watch for demons or other wandering monsters. At one point the door closed, and Vallium was unable to re-open it from inside.  Michael was fortunately able to open it from outside, and they realized how all those people had died in that hallway -- the entrance was a one-way door, and it was stone and too sturdy to smash.  Fortunately only two of them had gone in.

They thought they had enough loot for one day, so they started discussing whether to fight the halflings or sneak loot past the halflings.  (The idea of actually paying 10% of the loot to the halflings didn't come up.)  Merenuithiel was in favor of fighting them, but the group eventually decided to try stealth this time.  The plan was to circle around known dungeon passages to the west of the entrance room to get as close to the stairs as possible before the halflings saw them, and to have Vael cast Invisibility on both Michael (who could carry a lot of loot) and Merenuithiel (who had not purchased an Adventuring License and would prefer not to).  Then Vael and Vallium would lead Ioannes, still raving about the demon, past the halflings and grudgingly pay 10% of a small decoy haul of non-magical weapons and coins, while the good stuff went by invisibly.  The combination of Invisibility and Ioannes's ranting were enough to cover the two people sneaking, and the group paid a total of 3 spears (which would have been annoying to carry anyway) as their tithe for the week.

Ioannes wasn't in great shape for climbing down the Long Stair, so Vael Levitated the two of them down while the other three walked.  They all eventually made it back to Gosterwick, and took Ioannes straight to the temple of Demma for a Remove Curse spell.  Vael then set to learning Analyze Magic so he could avoid paying the Arcane Practitioners' Club to identify every magical item they found.  And one of the items they found in the pit was truly amazing, a Gem of Insight, which could permanently boost someone's intelligence.



GM's Comments:

This was the second week in a row the group hit a teleporter.  This time it at least took them somewhere they recognized.  They had three fights this week, all of them pretty easy with the archer along.  They looted the victims of two different one-way door traps (one with a hidden escape teleporter, one possibly with no way out at all) that had each bagged many victims over the years.

Ioannes rolled a natural 3 when trying to figure out the pillar, which gave him the insight that he needed to grab the pillar while asking Thoth a question.  In addition to getting what sounded like an actual answer from Thoth, he also got an electric shock serious enough to result in a Major Wound, because that's how Arden Vul works.


Achievements:

Iconic Location: The Great Hall
Iconic Location: The Great Chasm
Thus Spake Thoth: All clerics talk to gods.  But Ioannes was the first PC to get a direct answer from one in this campaign.

XP:

Exploration: about 15 new locations, good for 1 XP
Loot: They found a lot of good stuff.  If they sell enough of it it should definitely qualify for 2 XP each.  If they insist on keeping the most valuable items then they will earn 1 XP instead.
Achievements: 2 XP for everyone for 2 Iconic Locations.  Ioannes got another 1 XP for getting a response from Thoth.


Next week:

Sounds like they definitely want to talk to the beastmen.  Maybe they'll fight the halflings, but Merenuithiel mentioned several times that they should do that when she's around, so maybe they'll wait until they have her available again.

# DFRPG Arden Vul Session 5: Parleys and The Great Cavern

Date:

Demmasday, 11th of Lucrios, 2993 AEP


Weather:

Cool, overcast, rainy


Player Characters:

Ioannes Grammatikos Byzantios, Archontean cleric of Demma (Demented Avenger)
Vael Sunshadow, Half-Elven mage (Kyle)
Vallium Halcyon, Archontean fighter (Greybrown)
Uvash Edzuson, Dwarven cleric of Zodarrim (Based Cosmo)
Sister Valya "Basilisk" Hushbreaker, halfling monk (Mercenary) (Archon Shiva)


Significant NPCs:

Lyssandra Astorion, principal of the Arcane Practitioners' Club
Freydis, steward to Lady Alexia Basilion
Lady Alexia Basileon, ruler of the town of Gosterwick
Roskelly Winterleaf, halfling underground toll collector lieutenant
Several halfling toll collectors
Many beastmen
Count Skleros, beastman military commander
2 ghouls
giant salamander
giant crab
clockwork dragonfly
Ptarmis, strange robed human
3 rock reptiles
Bellringer, goblin sub-chief
2 other goblins


After identifying the magical gem they found in the Pyramid of Thoth as a very valuable Gem of Insight, the group decided to sell it rather than keeping it.  Lyssandra mentioned the Gem to Lady Alexia's steward, Freydis, who invited the party for a meeting to discuss the Gem.  After some questions about the group and the Gem, Freydis arranged an audience with Lady Alexia herself.  Lady Alexia purchased the Gem, and also told the group about her Regalia, four items within Arden Vul that were extremely important to her, and for which she would richly reward the finders.  The Regalia named were the Bone Ring of Jagri-Naz, the Tablet of the Beacon, the Ebon Spear of Arden, and the Iron Circlet of Ghanor.  Lady Alexia did not go into further detail, saying that various delvers with whom she had shared information had failed to find any of the Regalia for years, so she'd prefer that new groups go in with fresh eyes lest flaws in her intelligence led them astray.  Asked if there was anything Gosterwick could do to assist the group with finding the Regalia and other important treasure, there was a general grumbling about a lack of magic items and special purpose adventuring gear for sale in town.  Lady Alexia said that she had some healing potions available for sale and would continue trying to improve the supply of other gear, but that Gosterwick was not exactly Archontos.

Ioannes decided to research the Regalia, but didn't find anything interesting in the Arcane Practitioners' Club's small library.  He also ordered some finer quality leather armor and a new axe.  Vallium spread more coin around the local taverns looking for information, visited Astableon the Scribe and Bookseller to buy a history book, and visited Chairduster's Fine Metallurgy to buy some gold and silver jewelry for dragon tribute.  Vael picked up his fancy new robes and also purchased some mundane adventuring equipment to leave in the ruins.  The group visited all three merchant factors in Gosterwick (Rarities Factor, Prosperity Factor, and Silent Factor) to look for a place to set up bank accounts, and Vael also got a reference to a lawyer who could set up an adventuring company as a legal entity.  Uvash returned from the House of the Gods to join the others on the trip, but Michael was once again out in the wilderness somewhere, so the group recruited the on-call mercenary at the Grudge Brigade, a tiny halfling monk called Basilisk.

They set out for the ruins of Arden Vul early the next morning.  Uvash recommended roping themselves together for safety in case of another slip on the Long Stair, but they didn't have enough rope for everyone.  Vael once again Levitated himself up the cliff face, and Basilisk rode in the wheelbarrow that Vallium was pushing.  This time everyone made it to the top without a slip, despite the rainy conditions.

They decided to first deliver the tribute to the dragon.  The party walked over to the dam and checked that the lock they had installed the week before was intact, stowed some equipment inside the dam, and left the tribute jewelry on top of the dam in a sack as the dragon had commanded.  They then proceeded to the Pyramid of Thoth and manipulated the statue's arms forward to open the safer entrance.

On the large landing room halfway down the steps inside the pyramid, they encountered Roskelly and a couple of his halfling toll collectors.  Basilisk hid.  After a brief conversation, the halflings went back downstairs to their territory, followed by the party.  Vallium walked over to the statue of Thoth and the base of the stairs, put his book in the offering chest, and loudly proclaimed that the offering was in Thoth's name.  Nothing happened.  They added some coins to the offering chest.  Nothing happened.  Vael theorized that maybe a mundane book wasn't good enough and it had to be magic scroll, but they didn't have any, so they recovered their book and coins.

The group proceeded south toward beastman territory.  When they crossed the barricade they yelled out for parley, rather than trespassing.  First a beastman trooper, then a sergeant, came to investigate.  After a brief discussion the sergeant said to wait, and returned a bit later with a beastman leader, Count Skleros, and his honor guard.  Skleros asked if they were the Cheese and Crackers group that had been trying to negotate, and after confirmation asked what they wanted.  Vael said they wanted safe passage through Children of Deino territory and access to any other dungeon entrances that faction might control.  Skleros wanted to know what they could do for him in exchange, and Vael asked what he needed.  Skleros gave a list: for the dragon to stop eating his troops, wood, iron, steel, mushrooms particularly a variety called Cloud Caps, fresh fruits and vegetables, magic items, and coins.  Vael said something about putting a good word in with the dragon and bringing some food next time, which Skleros said was fine, and they would give them safe conduct through their territory and tell them where the entrance was next time.  Vael asked if there was anything they could do today, and Skleros mentioned a small ghoul problem.  A couple of ghouls were in a room near a beastman guard post, and they were barricaded inside so they weren't currently a serious problem, but they were costing the beastmen the use of that room and also terrifying some of the soldiers.  He asked if any of the party were the kind of clerics who would make undead dead.

Unfortunately none of the clerics had undead destroying powers, but Vael had Create Fire, so he asked some details about the room where the ghouls were barricaded and whether anything important was inside.  Told it was about 25 feet square and there were no known valuables there, Vael cast Seek Earth looking for gold or silver inside to confirm.  Finding none, he used the newly found magic ring of seeing through things to look through the door of the room, then tried a large Create Fire to incinerate the ghouls without opening the door.  The first casting of the spell surprisingly failed, but eventually Vael managed to torch the room.  A few minutes later the group formed up and Vallium unbarred and opened the door, revealing a very hot room containing two charred corpses.  Ioannes chopped off their heads just to be sure.  Vael was very tired after incinerating a decent-sized room, but two clerics and a monk all started Lending Energy and pretty soon everyone was rested.

With the ghouls taken care of, Skleros instructed a sergeant to guide the party through their territory to the Great Cavern and give them directions to the exit.  The sergeant and a few troopers led the group across the Great Hall (telling them to run across before any gargoyles above noticed them and attacked), then through several rooms full of beastmen.  One room contained a bunch of parchments, possibly maps, that had been quickly turned upside-down to hide them from untrusted eyes.

At the south end of beastman territory, the sergeant handed the group off to another sergeant who said he was with the Long Range Cavern Patrol.  He said to climb down the cliff, go south until it wasn't possible to go south any more, than go east until they found a cave entrance, then go south and west until they found the exit.  He also said the cliff was infested with giant centipedes, and gave the group a bucket full of nasty smelling paste that he said repelled them.  He led them out to a cage, high in the air above a huge cavern full of glowing mushrooms.  The cage had a locked door leading to a ladder down into the cavern.

Everyone climbed or Levitated down to the cavern floor, then walked south to the top of a cliff, with the sound of running water below.  Vael Levitated down the cliff to scout ahead, and saw a stream with a small island with a worn stone statue on it.  But when he moved closer to investigate, a giant salamander showed interest, so Vael noped back up to the group.  Between them, they had more than 50' of rope, so Uvash tied everyone's ropes together and then tied one end to a spike the beastmen had placed at the top of the cliff, then everyone put on the giant centipede repellent and started climbing down.  (Except Vael Levitated, and the tiny Basilisk rode down on Vael's shoulders.)

Unfortunately, Uvash had critically failed his Climbing roll to set the rope, so the group was unknowingly actually free-climbing, not getting the bonus for the rope.  Fortunately, they all made their Climbing rolls without the bonus, so nobody fell.  Vael flew back up and untied the rope (which detached from the spike suspiciously easily) and returned it to its owners.  No giant centipedes had made an appearance, but nobody knew if that was because the repellent worked.

The group followed the north edge of the stream west until it emptied into an underground pond.  They walked along the north edge of the lake west until they saw a dock with a couple of fresh but unlit torches, and a couple of rowboats.  They lit the torches, which was mostly redundant because their Continual Light rocks were brighter, then continued walking west until they reached the other side of the pond, up against a rock wall.  There was no obvious way around; they needed to swim or boat or fly across.  Nobody in the group had any Boating skill, and they didn't know if they could trust the boats, so Vael decided to Levitate across to scout, with Basilisk on his shoulders.

Flying across, they saw a cave entrance high up above the water, with some interesting crystal formations inside, but did not go in to investigate.  They also spotted a sandy island in the middle of the pond, with a huge crab sitting on the beach, and a bit of apparently magical treasure in the sand.  Finally they spotted a second dock with another rowboat on the south side of the pond.  Vael and Basilisk flew back to the group to discuss their findings, and they all decided that fighting the crab was probably unnecessary and they might be able to scare it off and grab the treasure.

Vael and Basilisk flew back above the crab, and Vael dropped a Create Fire on top of it.  The crab jumped in alarm and then dove into the water.  Once the crab had been gone for a few seconds, Vael and Basilisk landed on the island and picked up three things that looked magical: a shield, a green square of glass, and a rusty suit of scale armor.  The armor was a bit heavy, so Vael cast a separate Levitation spell on Basilisk, who clung to the armor while Vael guided them both back to the north shore.

The scale armor was heavy and annoying to carry, so they decided to cast Analyze Magic right there in the cavern, despite it taking an hour, to see if it was worth the trouble.  While Vael was casting, a beastman came down the cliff to their north, hailed the group, then retreated back north.  Later, an 8" long clockwork dragonfly with blue gem eyes flew up to investigate them silently, then eventually flew away.  Finally, the Analyze Magic was finished, and revealed that the scale armor was not magical.  Vael asked Ioannes for a second opinion, and it didn't look magic to him either.  Vael had apparently critically failed his earlier Perception plus Magery check.  Scowling, they abandoned the rusty armor, but packed away the green glass square and took the magic shield.

Still not trusting the boats, Vael cast Levitation on the entire group and shuttled them all south above the lake.  It was tedious as he could only concentrate on moving one of them at a time, but it was only 20 yards from dock to dock, so the whole operation took less than a minute.  There were paths through the fungal forest to the southeast and southwest.  Following the earlier instructions, they went southeast.   To the south was a platform about 20' high covered with marble pavers.  Vael flew up to investigate, and on top of the platform saw a huge stone chair, containing a human wearing worn wizard robes and years of accumulated body odor.  The man identified himself as Ptarmis, the master of the cavern.  Deciding this guy was creepy, Vael excused himself and flew away.  Meanwhile the others climbed some stairs up to the south end of the platform and saw some huge block rock doors into the rock wall to the south, with no visible handles or keyholes, and a purple glowing light around the doors.

Everyone continued down a path to the east, which eventually became a cave entrance into a rock wall.  The path south was blocked by a cave-in, but Vallium led the group north then east then south down another passage.  The passage opened into a larger room, where they were ambushed by 3 rock reptiles.  The rock reptiles achieved surprise, but their initial Move and Attacks did not hit, and Vallium in front quickly regained his wits and was ready to defend against their next attacks.  Vael threw a Smoke spell to blind and confuse the reptiles.  The reptiles retreated from it while everyone else recovered from surprise.  Vael dropped the Smoke and cast a Thunderclap to try to deafen the reptiles, Ioannes cast Flaming Weapon on Vallium's sword.  Two of the reptiles decided that the Smoke followed by the Thunderclap were scary, and ran away.  The third on stood its ground, until Vallium stabbed and badly wounded it.  It failed its stun check, fell over, failed its consciousness check, and passed out.  The group finished it off then noticed there was a bit of treasure in the cavern: a couple of silver ingots, a potion, a small stone snake head that looked like it was broken off a statue, and a single magical boot.

They looked for the second boot and failed to find it.  Vael cast Seek Magic to try to find the second boot, and the spell said the nearest magic (excluding what they carried) was outside the cave, back in the big cavern.  The group decided to stay on target and left the cave to the south, then took a tunnel generally west.  Turning south, they found 3 goblins in a cave.  One of them spoke some Archontean and indicated that he did not want a fight.  He said that his name was Bellringer, he was a goblin sub-chief, and his group was returning from the Arena 3 levels down when they decided to look for King Weskenim's missing brother Gribble,  when they got ambushed by beastmen and most of them were killed.  He asked if the party had any food or knew a way down to the goblin caverns.  They gave most of their rations to the goblins, but told them that they didn't know the way.  Bellringer thanked them for the food and asked their names, and asked that if they met King Weskenim before he did, to relay the news.

The group left the goblins and continued north and west.  Ioannes was worried they were lost and wondered if they should double back to the Great Cavern, but the group decided to press on.  They found a giant boulder in a cave, and Vael Levitated up and saw that it had a flat spot on top that had been used as a campsite.  They found a passage south, which contained a couple of moldy beastman corpses.  Ioannes said they were too old to determine cause of death, and they had no treasure.  Continuing south, the group found a dead end, with a suspicious amount of graffiti.  The graffiti was in a mix of languages: Archontean, Elvish, and Dwarvish.  They decided to search for secret doors, and eventually found one.  Once they managed to open it, they found the Long Stair was right outside, and they were about two-thirds of the way up.

Vael didn't want to go home without finding the other magic boot, so having found the exit, the group doubled back to the Great Cavern.  Vael then flew up on top of the big rock where Seek Magic had pointed him.  Atop the rock was an old, creepy-looking pillar.  Vael tried inspecting the pillar closely, but doing so made him dizzy.  He backed away and found a hole on the other side of the big rock, leading down past the range of his Continual Light.  He dropped a purple glowing rock inside and saw the rock fall about 80' into another cave.  It was interesting, but a bit scary to investigate right now, so he flew back to the rest of the group, and they went back to the secret door, down the Long Stair, and back to Gosterwick.


GM's Comments:

The group achieved their goals for this week: talking with the beastmen and finding another entrance to the dungeon.  They weren't planning for the entrance to be all the way across the Great Cavern though.  They parleyed with Lady Alexia and Count Skleros and Bellringer.  They set ghouls on fire without opening the door and letting them hit back.  The got surprised by rock reptiles but killed one and scared the others off.  And they avoided every other possible fight.


Achievements:

Iconic Location: The Great Cavern


XP:

Exploration: 25 new locations explored, for 2 XP.
Loot: Magic shield, Flight potion, silver ingots, minus dragon tribute.  Selling the potion was enough for 1 XP.
Achievements: 1 XP for finding (with beastman help) and exploring the Great Cavern. 


Next week:

They are really sick of paying tribute to both halflings and the dragon, so it sounds like they'll be going back to the newly found entrance at the south end of the Great Cavern.  We'll see whether they decide to explore the cavern more or just use it as a route back to the Halls of Thoth.

# DFRPG Arden Vul Session 6: Good Ghost, Bad Ghost

Weather:

Warm, sunny

Vallium Halcyon, Archontean fighter (Greybrown)
Uvash Edzuson, Dwarven cleric of Zodarrim (Based Cosmo)
Ashe "Goat" Maykum, Goblin Druid (Mercenary) (Archon Shiva)

Wight


In Gosterwick, Ioannes did some additional research into Lady Alexia's Regalia and found that the Ebon Spear was the actual spear wielded by Arden when she was a mortal warrior hero, thousands of years ago.  Vallium again tried finding rumors about Plumthorn's halfling gang in various drinking establishments, and instead heard something about Ptarmis, a wizard who lived in the fungal caverns.

Michael was still out wandering in the wilderness, and Vael was busy studying (or possibly customizing his new wizard robes), so the group was an adventurer short this week.  They hired Ashe, the goat-summoning druid, from the Grudge Brigade.  There was some discussion on whether to visit the Great Cavern again or bring food to the beastmen, but Vallium suggested avoiding the Cavern since they didn't have a wizard with Levitation to deal with cliffs and water.  Instead they would just go down the Great Pyramid stairs and investigate unexplored parts of the Halls of Thoth. 

They woke before dawn, and walked uneventfully toward Arden Vul on a warm spring day.  At the base of the waterfall, Ashe used a Water Vision spell to see through all the spray, and made out a couple of cave entrances, behind the waterfall and 30 to 40 feet underwater.  While Ashe was staring into the water, Ioannes noticed a crumbling tower near the side of the road, and suggested (via gestures because the waterfall was too loud for speech) that they check it out.

The group entered the remains of the tower.  The top levels had fallen, but the ground level was fairly intact.  Vallium poked around in the rubble and found what he thought was a trap door to a cellar.  Ashe cast Shape Earth to help move rubble out of the way.  Vallium opened the trap door, and a terrifying ghost emerged, yelling something about Settite murderers.

Both Ioannes and Uvash fled in terror.  Vallium was a bit less scared but decided that following them made more sense than dealing with any angry ghost.  Ashe, however, stuck around to have a conversation.  The ghost attempted to possess Ashe, but failed.  It then shot some kind of magical bolt out of a finger and missed.  Ashe eventually gave up on discussion and followed the others out of the tower, surrounded by goats and rats and bats.  The ghost did not pursue outside the tower.

After recovering from their fright, everyone hiked up the Long Stair, with Vallium pushing a new wheelbarrow containing everyone's backpacks.  Nobody slipped.  When they reached the top, the group headed toward the Pyramid of Thoth and managed to avoid any encounters.  They manipulated the statue's arms, read some graffiti, and walked down several hundred stairs to the Glory of Thoth.  There they were greeted by their favorite halfling extortion gang, who collected 25 pieces of silver from Vallium for an Adventuring License for Ashe.  (Roskelly generously allowed the goats and swarms to adventure for free.)

Since Ashe had Water Vision, the group headed south through the gray-green mist to the smelly murky pool, hoping the spell would reveal some treasure.  Sadly, it did not.  Ashe complained about the people who failed to throw coins into fountains, and then threw a single coin in.  Vallium suggested going east to avoid beastman territory.  The group went through a previously discovered secret passage, into a room full of columns that had previously contained some flying jellyfish-like creatures.  There were 3 more of the cephalopods there this time, and they appeared hungry.

A battle ensued, but the jellyfish weren't very tough, and went down fairly quickly to a combination of Vallium's sword blows and Ashe's bat swarms.  One of them did manage to shock a goat before it died.  All the bodies in the room had already been looted, so the group headed east, then north to an unexplored door.  It was difficult to open, but Vallium got some help from Ioannes and the door opened to a long narrow north-south corridor, this one not full of corpses.  Vallium carefully checked for a way to open the door from the other side, then stepped into the passage.  Only a couple of steps in, the floor collapsed under him, revealing a 20' deep pit.  Vallium grabbed the edge of the pit and pulled himself up.  There was no obvious treasure in the pit, and the group decided that this area would be safer to explore with Levitation available.

They doubled back to the column room and took the southern exit on the east wall.  This led to a room with a lot of trash on the floor and a door on the far wall.  The door was very stuck and Vallium had a hard time opening it, so Ashe sent two goats repeatedly ramming into the door until it eventually opened.  (Somehow, all the noise failed to draw any wandering monsters.)  Beyond the stuck door was a room with stone benches on every wall.  Ioannes painstakingly searched every bench, and was rewarded with a secret compartment in the last one he searched.  It contained a bolt of yellow silk, a lantern and oil, and a book written in some language that nobody knew.  They took everything.

A passage led east out of the room.  Following it, they saw a door to the south and a room to the east, and they went east into the room.  It had a mosaic of the stars on the floor, and a sky blue ceiling with stars painted on it.  Ashe thought the stars were the constellation of the Ibis, but the others were less sure.  There were wooden stalls on the walls all around the room, with one larger stall in the middle of the eastern wall, and an exit further north on the eastern wall.  Vallium searched the larger stall, and thought there was a secret door behind it, but couldn't figure out how to open it.  Ioannes suggested searching all the stalls, and after a long search the group found a couple of potions (one of them looking magical, one not; Ashe thought that was was poison), some old silver coins, a fancy ceremonial headdress, a couple more of the magical colored glass squares (green and yellow), and an ancient erotic book called The Seventy-Four Ways of Opening the Lotus, in Mithric, but with pictures.  Once everyone tired of looking at the book, Vallium asked for help figuring out the secret door.  Nobody could find a hidden catch or keyhole, so Ashe told the two goats to again take turns ramming into the door.  After a few smashes, one of them accidentally hit a hidden catch and the door opened.

On the other side of the door was a combination bedroom and study.  A very short translucent figure sat up from the desk and warmly greeted the party with gestures.  They could not hear his voice when he tried to speak, but he apparently understood them.  He pointed at some blueprints on the desk, which said "Tomb of Jacobus, the 52nd Claustral Prior of the Chapter of Thoth."  There was a map there, of three rooms.  Jacobus pointed to the map then pointed to the north.  After a lot of gesturing and nodding and shaking of his head, he got the idea across that this was his tomb and his body wasn't properly buried in it for some reason and he'd like some help with that.  He then pointed to an armoire, and when they opened it, to a hat inside, and then when Ioannes looked at the hat he found it contained a key.  Jacobus pointed to the key and then led the group out the secret door, north, east down a passage to a looted storeroom.  Jacobus pointed to the north wall, then to the key, until the PCs searched and found a secret door.

A short passage led north, then jagged left a bit and suspiciuously dead-ended.  Everyone searched for a secret door in the obvious place, and found one.  Jacobus had stayed behind in the storeroom.  Vallium figured out how to open the secret door, and stepped through.

On the other side was a room full of burial niches and sarcophagi, many of them looted and destroyed.  A couple of ghouls were charging toward the party.  They decided to let the ghouls come to them, allowing a retreat through the secret door if needed.  This tactic lasted a couple of seconds before Ashe decided to send his goats and bat and rat swarms into the room to draw attacks.  Two ghouls were visible at first, and later five more ghouls and a wight were spotted.  Ashe cast a Hail spell between the undead and the party, which meant the undead had to take Hail damage in addition to swarm damage before they could hurt anyone important.  It was a long grinding fight, but ultimately Vallium's sword and the swarms took down all of the undead.  The ghouls landed a couple of hits on Vallium, but failed to penetrate his armor.  The undead managed to kill a couple of the swarms, but Ashe said that was fine and he could just make more.

With the undead gone, the party investigated the room.  There were open double doors to the southwest, facing the Great Chasm.  There was a single tomb with a fancy gisant to the northeast.  And there was a rather short skeleton on the ground near the east wall.  Ioannes went back to get the blueprints, which showed where the secret door leading to Jacobus's tomb should be.  The group found the secret door in the expected spot, went in, and found an unoccupied sarcophagus and a bunch of treasure.  Vallium reverently put Jacobus's skeleton in the sarcophagus, as both Uvash and Ioannes said a few appropriate words.  Jacobus's ghost came running into the room, bowed to everyone, and dived into the sarcophagus on top of his skeleton.  Before disappearing, he pointed to the side of the sarcophagus.  Uvash thought Jacobus was just saying to close it, but Vallium thought he might be pointing to something, and searched.  There was a secret compartment there, containing a belt and a ring.

The party picked up all the portable treasure from the tomb.  This included a locked chest.  Ashe suggested smashing it with goats, but Uvash said that if there was anything fragile inside that might smash it, so they decided to just take the chest and pay someone in Gosterwick to open it.

Discussion of the chest made everyone remember the halflings.  Vallium mentioned maybe just giving them their 10% for once, but Ashe scoffed and suggested using Mystic Mist instead.  The plan was to approch the Glory of Thoth from the northwest entrance, only 10 yards from the stairs up to the pyramid, then cast a big Mystic Mist over the whole northeast corner of the room, and march the treasure out while the halflings were confused by the mist.  One of Roskelly's fighters saw the mist appear, and Roskelly sent a couple of halflings in to investigate, but both ran back out screaming, and then the PCs were up the stairs,  Roskelly was yelling after them, though; this time the halflings knew they'd been cheated of their share of the loot.


GM's Comments:

Three fights this week: quickly running away from a ghost, quickly dispatching some chasm cephalopods, and then a long grindy fight against some ghouls and a wight.  Only Vallium and Ashe got to do much, but the PCs won.  Summoned swarms are pretty powerful, but more combatants mean slower combats.  They found a lot of treasure in Prior Jacobus's tomb, and only had to split it 4 ways, so it was a profitable delve.


Achievements:

Quest: Prior Jacobus's Ghost


XP:

Exploration: 10 new locations explored, for 1 XP.
Loot: That locked (and trapped!) chest was full of coins.  2 XP.
Achievements: 1 XP for giving Prior Jacobus a proper burial.


Next week:

The party has progressed from sneaking treasure past the halflings in deniable ways to brazenly walking treasure past them with obvious magic.  We'll see if they return to the scene of the crime or decide to go somewhere else.

DFRPG Session 7: Why Did It Have to Be Plants?
Date:

Demmasday, 25th of Lucrios, 2993 AEP


Weather:

Cool, light rain


Player Characters:

Ioannes Grammatikos Byzantios, Archontean cleric of Demma (Demented Avenger)
Vallium Halcyon, Archontean fighter (Greybrown)
Uvash Edzuson, Dwarven cleric of Zodarrim (Based Cosmo)
Michael J. Dundee, Thorcin barbarian (Adam)
Ethereum "Coinbase" Thuringwador, Elf Illusionist (Mercenary) (Archon Shiva)


Significant NPCs:

Mountain Lion
6 Stirges
Pig-Headed Beastman
Several Large Albino Baboons
Assassin Vine
Shambling Mound


Ioannes spent some time reading the Book of Priors the group had found in their last delve.  It was thousands of pages long, written in dense Mithric by a succession of Priors of Thoth, over the years 937 to 1782 AEP.  Amidst all the church records, he found about twelve levels of the Halls described.  There was also mention of two different species conquered by the great Archon Marius Tricodor: the varumani (big strong regenerators) and the heqeti (demon-worshipping amphibians).  He also managed to find a spare healing kit at the Temple of Demma and made a donation to have it reassigned to him.

Vallium went looking for rumors of Plumthorn's halflings, and heard that they were selling "exploration licenses" (confirmed!) and also that messing with them was a bad idea because they had magic wands.

Vael was still tied up in magical research and/or getting his new robes to look right, but Michael had returned from his latest trip into the wilderness.  Short a mage, the group hired the Grudge Brigade leader Coinbase again, since he was available and definitely good at selling treasure, as well as allegedly being able to cast some spells.

The party woke up before dawn on a rainy Demmasday and trudged the usual several hours toward the Ruins.  Nobody slipped on the Long Stair, but a very brave or very hungry mountain lion decided that Vallium, at the back of the group, looked like a nice meal, and pounced on him from behind.  It managed to bite him hard in the back of the neck, but did not account for how thick his armor was, and mostly just hurt its teeth.  Vallium stabbed the big cat to death, and Coinbase reminded them that his minion Goat would pay for corpses of animals he hadn't previously seen, so they stuck the body behind some trees and hoped it would still be there when they returned.

Continuing up the Long Stair to the Ruins, the group had a brief discussion on where to go.  They didn't feel ready to fight the halflings (though as usual they spent some time talking smack about them).  Vallium suggested exploring the islands in the middle of the Upper Swift River.  Ioannes and Coinbase mentioned exploring some more of the ruined city wall and its guard towers.  They compromised by starting with the towers since they were closer, planning to visit the islands later.

Heading east from the entry into the ruins, they inspected a crumbling piece of city wall, then found a mostly intact round tower in the southeast corner.  Four of them were able to climb the more stable looking wall to the east of the tower, but Coinbase failed to climb it and doubled back to the ruined wall to the west, which was easier to climb but looked more likely to collapse.  The two groups entered the tower from opposite sides, and were able to see each other across the mostly empty upper floor of the tower.  They heard noise above, like loud chittering birds.  As they entered the tower, several stirges dove down from above to defend their lair.  The angry birds fought without any tactical sense, just charging at the nearest intruder.  Vallium and Michael swatted a couple down, while Coinbase summoned a semi-illusionary Phantom.  With three of the stirges dead, the others decided to retreat, and they were too fast to catch.  The group searched the tower but found no treasure.  They grabbed a strix corpse to sell to Goat.

Continuing north, they found a ruined square tower containing a large bees nest.  Giving the nest a wide berth, they saw another square tower ahead, and spotted a pig-headed beastman peeking around the corner of the tower at them.  They approached warily, but by the time they summoned the courage to peek around the tower, the beastman was nowhere to be seen.

There was a break in the city's eastern wall, and then another square tower ahead.  When the group got within about 20 yards of the tower, a large white baboon stuck its head out a window and hooted at them, then threw a rock at Vallium.  The rock missed.  A lot of hooting ensued in the tower, and a couple more rocks.  Some more hooting answered from a cistern east of the tower.  The group discussed rushing the baboons, then decided that wasn't a great idea, and backed away.

There was a semi-intact ruin of a manor house to the west.  Most of the group spent about an hour digging through it, while Vallium stood guard.  They didn't find anything particularly interesting; maybe this ruin had already been picked over.  While they were searching, a wyvern flew by to the south, took a good look at them, then flew off to the west.  This time, it didn't try to drop anything on them.

At this point they decided to head northwest and explore the islands.  There was a foot bridge leading from west of the forum to the southern island.  The bridge was only about five feet wide and appeared to be made of iron, so it was impressive that it was still standing.  With some caution they crossed it, and it did not collapse.  They continued north through some nondescript ruins until they saw a ruined palace, with some kind of domed greenhouse still standing in its east wing.  The front doors were also still standing, about fifteen feet tall and black.  As they approached the door, a voice shouted out in Mithric "Stand aside, citizen.  This is not your home."  They tried talking to whoever was inside, but got no answer.  Eventually the voice repeated the same line again, and they decided it was pre-programmed rather than someone actually talking.

The front doors looked sturdy, but parts of the wall had collapsed, so they went around.  They walked into a ruined antechamber that held a couple of desiccated corpses, but no treasure.  They went east to the greenhouse, which was surprisingly intact.  It was about four stories tall, with catwalks crisscrossing the building, a transparent roof that let light in, and plants and even a few trees everywhere.  There was a fountain in the center of the greenhouse, still working.  They poked around looking for something of interest, and something of interest found them.

An assassin vine, basically a human-sized pitcher plant with a couple dozen tendrils for dragging prey into its maw, greeted them with a couple of tendrils each.  They were surprised by this and stood around watching for a couple of seconds while the tendrils grabbed most of them.  Ioannes was as surprised as the rest of them, but he was wearing the Ring of Free Action they found in the Priors' hoard, and the tendrils were unable to get a good grip on him.  Michael, though theoretically as surprised as the rest of them, showed off his Combat Reflexes by rolling a natural 3 on his dodge, jumping away from both tendrils and also snapping out of stun.

The assassin vine was very strong, and managed to knock both Vallium and Uvash prone and drag them forward toward its mouth.  However, the tendrils were not very tough, and everyone started chopping them to release their friends.  Michael chopped the tendril holding Coinbase, freeing the elf to cast a Phantom, which fooled the not-very-smart plant that it was real, and started ripping off tendrils. Ioannes chopped a tendril off Vallium.  Vallium started cutting the tendrils grabbing him, but as the plant dragged him within range of his body, decided to concentrate on the larger target instead, and hit the plant's body hard enough to stun it, causing it to release its grappled victims.  With the plant stunned, Michael ran up, and he and Vallium stabbed the plant from both sides enough to make it stop moving.  The whole group then spent some time making sure it was dead.

Near the dead plant, the group spotted the ancient corpse of what looked like a noble woman.  Ioannes tried to diagnose the cause of death, but the body was too old.  However, there was some kind of huge rod of office, and a platinum circlet, and a signet ring, and a shortsword.  Ioannes was pretty sure both the rod and the sword were magical.  They searched the corpse and also found a few rubies, a key, three small silver ankhs, and a fist-sized chunk of orange rock, which Ioannes thought was magical and the group suspected might be the rumored Arcanum.

After looting the body, the group checked out the fountain, but didn't find anything interesting in it.  They continued to the east of the solarium, and ran smack into another plant creature.  This one was a big smelly bipedal slimy mess.  This fight was a lot faster than the previous one, Vallium hit it quickly and got if off-balance, and then he and Michael and Coinbase's Phantom triple-teamed it.  Ioannes cast Flaming Weapon on Vallium's sword, but the fire didn't seem to do anything to the soggy plant.  However, by then the Phantom had pinned it to the ground, and Vallium and Michael were taking turns chopping off large bits of plant matter.  Uvash joined in and smacked it with his mace and finished it off.  The Shambling Mound had no treasure.

Leaving the solarium and returning to the ruined palace, Ioannes found a magical ring of paving stones, about 6' in diameter, with a rectangular grid of 6 8" by 8" squares nearby.  Vallium asked if the squares were the same size as the glass squares they had found.  They didn't have the glass squares with them, but they looked about the same size.  They searched the palace a bit more, and Uvash found a tapestry of a hunt in decent condition, but otherwise they found no other treasure.

After leaving the place through the hole in the wall, they saw larger bridges east (back toward the forum) and west (to the west side of the Swift River.)  To the east was a plinth with the feet of a large statue, but the rest of the statue was nowhere to be seen.  They crossed and took a closer look, and the feet were sculpted with heavy boots, possibly representing armor.  Someone asked if the feet matched the statue part they'd found in a basin to the east, and they appeared to be about the same scale and material, but since this was feet and the other part was an arm and hand, it would not be possible to fit them together and be sure.

Heading back south toward the Long Stair, Vallium suggested stopping at the obelisk to see if the silver ankhs they'd found matched the indentations on the obelisk.  Sure enough, all three ankhs matched.  However, inserting one didn't cause anything obvious to happen.  They reclaimed the ankh rather than leaving it in the obelisk.  They tend continued south to the Long Stair.  The mountain lion corpse was still where they left it, so they put it in the wheelbarrow and dragged it home for sale.


GM's Notes:

I don't think I ran the stirges very well.  One problem with random encounters is the GM doesn't know what's going to happen until it does, so there's not a lot of time to review the monster description -- but I should do it anyway.  It's worth burning 5 minutes at the start of a long fight to make the rest of the fight run more correctly and smoothly.

The assassin vine, though, worked pretty well.  It was the first monster to achieve decisive surprise against this party.  Fortunately for them, it's not a fast killer -- it takes a while to grapple its victims, then knock them down, then drag them toward its maw, then digest them.

I rolled for whether the shambling mound heard the fight with the assassin vine and decided to join in.  Fortunately for the PCs, it did not.  Getting tag-teamed by both of them at once would have been much harder than fighting them one at a time ended up being.  This week demonstrated that dumb monsters do not always have the best tactics.

Amusingly, none of the monsters they found this session had any treasure (unless you count their bodies), but the dead noble lady's body in the Solarium had a bunch of it.


Achievements:

The Archon's Palace was an Arden Vul Iconic Location

XP: 
Exploration: 6 new locations explored, good for 1 XP
Loot: The rubies and platinum circlet they found will be enough for 1 XP each.  If they want to hit the 2 XP bonus loot threshold, they'll need to sell the dead noblewoman's magic rod and/or magic shortsword.  Based on past behavior, they'll probably do that, after identifying them.
Achievements: 1 XP

Next week:

There was more smack talk about the halflings.  We'll see if they actually decide to fight them, or if they keep exploring other areas.

2025-04-28
All the Ways the PCs Know They Can Go in Arden Vul
One of the players posted a list of all the ways they could explore next on the campaign Discord.  Here's a shortened version:



2 caves behind the waterfall (beneath 35-40' of rough water)
Ruined tower near the base of the waterfall (ghost)
Secret entrance 2/3 of the way up the Long Stair, leading to the Great Cavern
Ruins of the city of Arden Vul
Northern island
Multiple watch towers
Square tower near Forum with bronze double doors
Square tower (bees)
Square tower and cistern (baboons)
Down the Well of Light (baboons and giant 4-armed baboons)
Pyramid of Thoth, move statue west 
Halls of Thoth (halflings)
Great Chasm
Lever on top of triangular pyramid, teleporter to Well of Light
Beastman territory
Stairs down, behind secret door in baboon mosaic
Chute down, opened by manipulating a statue
Pyramid of Thoth, move statue east
Black portal (demons)
Selket statue, teleporter to Great Hall (beastmen)

At least so far, Arden Vul has a large branching factor.  The PCs choose where to explore, and then instead of having one less choice (as they would if they exhausted a dead end), they usually find a couple more choices.

This makes prepping the dungeon more difficult for the GM, because I can't always guess where players will go next, so I have to have a lot of areas prepared.  This is probably good though, because it gives me incentive to prep more each week, so I'll finish prepping the whole adventure sooner.

I think having a lot of choices is good for players, because if they get stuck in one place they can go somewhere else.  However, it does require players to have good memories, or take good notes, or buy Eidetic Memory, so they don't forget about all those loose ends.

Last delve, the party found a very heavy and regal-looking magical rod on the richly dressed female corpse in the solarium of the Archon's Palace of Arden Vul.  They brought it to Vael to analyze, but he gave up after finding a couple of enchantments.  They then took it to Lyssandra and Pelteon at the Arcane Practitioners' Club, who identified a bunch more enchantments but said it only had a few charges left, and said Lady Alexia might want it.  The group decided to sell the rod to Lady Alexia, and also sold her the noblewoman's magic shortsword since none of them used a shortsword.

Lady Alexia's steward Freydis asked for a meeting to discuss where the items were found and any other details the finders could share.  Vallium showed up for the meeting and explained that they'd found the rod and shortsword on a desiccated corpse of a nobly dressed woman in the solarium, and that the body had also had a signet ring.  Freydis looked at the signet ring and then asked Vallium to return later, after she had a chance to converse with Lady Alexia.  When Vallium came back, Lady Alexia herself was waiting along with Freydis.  The Green Lady said that the signet ring was definitely from her family, Basileon, and that she would like to buy it if possible.  She also said she thought the body they had found was probably her ancestor Uriel Basileon, the last Archon of the city of Arden Vul before it was destroyed, and that she would appreciate the group showing some of her knights where the body was, so they could give it a proper burial.  Vallium agreed.

The night before before leaving, Uvash cast Bless on Ioannes from the scroll they had found, and then Ioannes cast Bless on the other four PCs using the spell.  Vael made a pile of Continual Light rocks.

Early the next morning, when the party arrived at the Water Gate, there were three Knights of the Azure Shield waiting for them, along with three squires, and a teamster driving a horse-drawn wagon.  The leader of the knights introduced herself as Sir Lucia, a Knight Commander, and said they were tasked with recovering the body of the Archon.  The knights had horses and the PCs did not, so the knights offered to let them ride in the wagon.  (It wasn't much faster than walking, but it was easier.)

Eventually the large group reached the base of the cliff face leading up to Arden Vul.  Sir Lucia detailed a knight and a squire to stay with the horses and wagon, while two knights and two squires roped themselves together before starting the climb up the Long Stair.  Noticing the PCs weren't roped together, Sir Lucia asked if they wanted to borrow any rope.  They did, and roped themselves together, except for Vael who chose to Levitate instead of walking.

The group made it about two-thirds of the way up the Cliff Face without mishap, but then Michael slipped on the rainy trail, and Uvash was unable to quickly steady him.  He looked like he was hurtling over the edge, possibly dragging Uvash behind him, when he suddenly tripped and got stuck behind a root near the edge.  His Bless spell was gone, but had saved him from a possibly fatal fall.  The group continued to the top, and then Ioannes asked the knights for a rest break and cast another Bless on Michael.  The knights stood at near-attention showing off that they didn't need to rest despite the long climb in armor, while Ioannes recovered from casting the major spell.

Fully rested, the PCs led the knights north to the Forum, then west across a bridge to the island, then north to the ruins of the Archon's Palace.  Vallium then chose the same gap in the wall as last time, and led the group back into the solarium.  Archon Basileon's body was where they had left it.  One of the squires pulled a canvas burial sack out of his pack, the Knight Commander said a few words, then two squires packed the corpse into the bag and carried it out.  Vael asked the knights if they needed an escort back to the top of the Long Stair, but Sir Lucia said the path was pretty simple and two knights and two squires should be able to handle themselves, and said their farewells before heading back south.

The group had a discussion of where to explore next.  Going back under the Pyramid of Thoth to deal with the halflings was the most popular idea, but Vael suggested scouting with an invisible Wizard Eye rather than just attacking, as they still weren't sure how many halflings there were.  Everyone agreed, and then they walked to the top of the pyramid, manipulated the statue's arms to uncover the stairs down toward the Glory of Thoth, and went down the stairs to the second landing, about 350' above the halflings.  There Vael stopped to cast Wizard Eye, then cast Invisibility on his Wizard Eye, then send the Wizard Eye downstairs to spy.  He indicated that all this spellcasting would be very strenuous, and would appreciate if Uvash and Ioannes could lend him some energy while he did that.  All the casting went well, and the Wizard Eye went flew down the stairs into darkness.  Vael quickly discovered that navigating a pitch black stairway wasn't easy, even for a flying eye, but managed to avoid slamming the Eye into any walls at high speed, until it could see torchlight ahead.

While Vael was steering the Wizard Eye, a group of four giant rats smelled food and came charging into the room.  Vallium and Michael and Uvash and Ioannes fought the rats, while Vael sat in the corner and focused on not losing his Wizard Eye.  They managed to defeat the rats without anyone sustaining injury, with three rats killed and the last one scurrying away back down the stairs.

Meanwhile, the Wizard Eye emerged into the Glory of Thoth, where Roskelly and five other halflings were standing guard in the shadows near the central statue, watching the various entrances to the room more vigilantly than in the past.  The Eye flew east, through a gap in the portcullis and past two more halflings guarding it.  The corridor went dark again, but there were lit rooms in three directions: east, north, and south.

The eye went east first, and found a room containing a halfling sitting on a bedroll reading and writing letters, two more halflings guarding an entrance to the Great Chasm in the northeast of the room, and a human man taking some notes.  Vael's Eye spied on the human first; his writing seemed to involve some alchemical processes, which Vael didn't understand in detail.  He then spied on the halfling, and saw that this was Plumthorn, reading a letter about how a certain merchant in Newmarket was severely late with his protection money, and writing a short note back instructing that it was time to break some knees.

The Eye went back to the dark crossroads, and then flew north.  The next lit room contained about nine halflings.  Once again there was access to the Great Chasm, and two halflings were guarding it.  Most of the others were sitting around a campfire, talking.  One was writing a letter, which appeared to be of a romantic nature.

Finally, Vael flew the Eye south.  Its view of the torch-lit room to the south was interrupted by some kind of barricade, but it didn't fill the whole passage, so the Eye was able to easily fly up over it.  The room to the south contained many bedrolls, some of them with sleeping halflings inside.  There was a barricade in the southeast corner of the room, guarded by two halflings, and leading to a dark tunnel sloping down.  The Eye couldn't see far enough into the dark tunnel to know what was down there.

Having explored everything he could see, Vael stopped maintaining the Wizard Eye.  After a bit of rest, the group discussed going downstairs and attacking the halflings, but the combination of the vigilance of Roskelly's vanguard, and the number of reinforcements available in the other rooms, made them decide to prepare more and return another day.  They went back up the stairs, out of the Pyramid, and then south to the Forum.  Vael wanted to cast Analyze Magic on the magical bronze doors to the square tower there.

He managed to cast the long spell without interruption, and found that the doors were Magelocked.  There were additional enchantments, but he figured Magelock was enough to keep them out so it wasn't worth spending more time at the doors.  With the doors probably impassible, their other choice for the square tower was to fly everyone up to the roof then descend down the stairs into magical darkness.  That seemed dangerous, so someone suggested going back to the Great Pyramid, down the other staircase, and using the bust of Selket with a scorpion on her head there to teleport to the Great Hall, near the (mostly friendly, or at least more friendly than the halflings) Children of Deino.

They manipulated the arms of the statue of Thoth to point straight up to reveal the less-used entrance, then walked down the stairs.  They expected a pit trap at the end of the hallway, but did not expect the stairs to turn into a ramp and attempt to help them into the pit, as that had failed to trigger last time.  This time, it again failed to trigger for Vallium in the lead, but worked correctly when Michael in the second position stepped onto the trapped stair.  Fortunately for them, both Vallium and Michael reacted quickly when the stairs collapsed under their feet.  Michael jumped back onto the safe stairs, and Vallium, too far down the ramp to reach the stairs, managed to wedge himself between the two walls of the narrow tunnel and hold on until help arrived.  The help was Vael casting a Flight spell on Vallium.  Vallium flew back to the rest of the group, tested to see if he was strong enough to pick up Michael, then carried Michael down the ramp and into the bottom of the pit of bones.  There were no demons there, so Vallium left Michael there and flew back to grab the others, and carried each of them in turn before the Flight spell expired.

Fully assembled, the group continued east into the room with the scary black portal and the bust of Selket with the teleport trap.  This time, instead of one small spherical demon with a lot of teeth, there were three.  Nobody achieved surprise, and the demons charged Vallium and Michael and Uvash in the front.  They killed one of the demons, another escaped through the black portal, and the third disappeared into the portal just as Michael ran his sword through it, so they were not quite sure if they killed it.

Vael suggested searching the room again, but sadly they found no additional treasure.  He then decided to send a Wizard Eye into the black portal to check it out, but lost contact with the Wizard Eye immediately when it went through.  He wasn't sure exactly what that meant, except that they definitely didn't want to go into that portal.  Instead, they formed up by the bust of Selket, and all pulled the scorpion's tail at the same time, expecting to teleport to the Great Hall.

They teleported, but somewhere else!  They were in an underground cavern, larger in every direction than their Continual Light illuminated, with an underground stream rushing by near their feet.  Looking around, they spotted a tent, and a magical circle of paving stones next to an array of 8"x8" stone square frames, just like the one they saw in the ruins of the Archon's Palace.  They were looking for a good spot to cross the water to check out the tent, when a loud voice erupted in broken Archontean.  Who were they and what were they doing in his cave?

There was an 8' tall green creature, like a double-sized goblin, wearing a shiny silver cloak, standing in front of them.  At least it wasn't attacking them.  A long conversation occurred.  His name was Gog, he was a varumani, and this was his cave.  They explained that they had hit a teleporter and he laughed and asked if they had any food.  Ioannes offered some rations and Gog spit and explained that he wanted good surface food, not yucky rations.  Someone made a snide comment about being surprised that this thing spoke Archontean and Gog replied that he probably spoke more languages than they did and they should be more polite.  A quick test revealed that Gog understood at least a few words of both Elvish and Dwarvish.

Ioannes asked if Gog was friends with the halflings and he said that, no, he was friends with the goblins and the halflings were not so he didn't much like the halflings.  But, no, he didn't eat halflings, eating other sentients was uncivilized.  Asked for information, Gog indicated that they should bring food in trade, but quickly pointed around and said that the goblins were to the southeast and they were his friends and nobody should hurt them, and that the Hall of Forty Pillars and the Obsidian Gates were up a hill to the north and that going that way would probably be fatal and not to yell to Gog for help if they insisted on doing it.  Asked if he knew how to get back up to the surface, Gog led them northeast, opened a secret door, and showed them a staircase leading up.  He said it led to a secret door south of the halflings.

The conversation was rudely interrupted by two humans and a halfling falling from the ceiling and hitting the ground a bit to the west.  Gog, not appearing very surprised, walked over to check on them.  The halfling had a broken leg.  Both humans had the wind knocked out of them, but were mostly okay.  One of the humans, a very good-looking warrior, introduced himself as Dalton.  He said that his adventuring party had been just west of the Glory of Thoth, messing with the arms of a statue, when a pit opened up under three of them and sent them down a chute.  His companions were named Helga and Isidor.  Isidor asked if anyone had a healing potion, and Dalton gave him one.  There was a brief discussion about Plumthorn's halfling thugs, who Dalton admitted paying off to be allowed to pass through their territory.  Isidor made it clear that he was a adventurer, not one of Plumthorn's gang.  Dalton asked if anyone knew the way back up, and Gog let the PCs show him the secret door.  Dalton said that they needed to get back to the rest of the group before anyone got too worried, but they should meet again sometime at the Inn of the Broken Head and have a longer conversation.  Ioannes asked if that was in Gosterwick, and Dalton laughed and said it was in the northwest of the ruins, and he had no idea how anyone could get this deep in the Halls of Arden Vul without even finding the Broken Head.  Vael was suspicious.

With the other adventuring party gone, the PCs asked Gog if he was okay with them exploring.  Gog pointed to his tent and an island in the stream and said "leave Gog's stuff alone", and then pointed to the southeast and said "don't hurt the goblins", and then pointed at the water and said "do not destroy environment only take a few fish not all the fish" but indicated that otherwise they could go where they wanted.  They decided to go northeast, where there was a steep slope down about 25 feet, with some old human and goblin corpses at the bottom.  Vallium threw a Continual Light rock down the hill to light the way ahead before they went down.

The slope was steep enough that Vael cast Flight on Vallium again and let him help people down.  Iaonnes checked the corpses for signs of death and saw that one of the goblins had died violently, but beyond that wasn't very sure.  Vael spotted magic and found that one corpse had a small magical silver statue of an eye.  He had no idea what it was, but pocketed it.  The bodies also had a stone axe, a few crystals and pearls that might be worth something, and a scroll of Thothian religious sayings that Uvash thought was worth taking.

The cavern continued northeast.  There were a lot of bats flying around, and there was a shelf to the north, up beyond the edge of their light.  Vael decided to send a Wizard Eye up there to explore, but the last thing the Wizard Eye saw was the mouth of a giant bat chomping it out of existence.  Vael cast Seek Earth for gold to get an indication of which way to go, and detected gold close by to the south.  Much searching for secret doors commenced, and nobody found one.  Vael pulled out the ring of looking through walls and saw a tunnel with piles of gold at the end.  He cast Seek Earth again and decided the gold was up a bit, so used Levitate to search higher.  Eventually the group went back west and found the secret door about fifteen feet up on a wall they had previously passed.  Vael could not figure out how to open it though.  He took turns casting Levitate on everyone, flying them all up, and having them all fail to figure out the trick.  Finally, they resorted to brute force, grabbing the stone axe off the corpse, and bashing the secret door until it caved in.  Somehow this failed to attract any wandering monsters.

The secret door led to a short tunnel with a door at the far end, with no gold visible.  Vael started to suspect the ring was cursed, as the information it provided was not always useful.  Vallium dropped a rope from the tunnel down to the cave floor, and everyone successfully climbed it.  The group listened at the door, heard nothing, and opened it.  On the other side was a Thothian tomb, with a body levitating in the air, wearing a gold helmet and an iron ankh, four Thothian statues lining the walls, and some golden furniture on the other side of the room.  A booming voice said, in Mithric, "You have found me; let me lie."

Ioannes said that he would be happy to let the body lie but there might be treasure.  Vael was pretty sure the statues were stone guardians that would try to kill them, and tried detecting magic.  One of the statues was magic, so he slowly cast Analyze Magic to determine its nature.  Meanwhile Ioannes checked out the gold furniture.  He picked up a gold chair, which turned out to be suspiciously light.  When he sat on it, it collapsed under his weight, revealing that it was just an old wooden chair painted yellow.  The Analyze Magic showed the only magic on the statue was just the sound illusion causing it to yell warnings.

Deciding that maybe the statues wouldn't kill them after all, Vael used Apportation to try to grab the golden helmet from the corpse.  This triggered a trap, with green gas starting to spew from all four statues.  Four out of five PCs immediately ran for the exit.  Vael instead started casting Purify Air spells.  He critically failed the first one, but instantly used his Luck to get a reroll before learning the consequences of failure.  Purify Air was an area spell, and casting one big enough to clear the whole room would be expensive, but his idea was to keep running around the room casting cheap one-hex Purify Air spells until all the gas was gone, like using a large number of tiny car air fresheners to clean a toxic waste dump.  Luckily for him, the trap had a finite amount of gas, and he didn't fail any more spell rolls after his Luck was used up, so he eventually cleared the room of the green gas.  He let the others know that the room was safe, and they all returned.  The golden helmet that had set off the trap turned out to be a fairly cheap-looking bronze helmet with a bit of gold plating.

Vael cast another Seek Earth for gold, excluding the helmet, and detected more gold nearby to the south.  Everyone searched for secret doors, and Vallium found that one of the statues could be moved and there was a door behind it.  Behind the door was a very cobwebby and dusty passage heading east.  Nobody say any huge spiders, so they all went down the passage, into another Thothian room.  There was an inscription on the wall in Mithric: "Knowledge of Thoth and His Mysteries Reveals the Way."

This room had four more statues, of Thoth in his scribe position, arms on knees.  Each had an 8" square hole, and each had a different object on its knees and a different inscription.  One statue had a torch and said "Thoth consumes light."  One had a figurine of a human and said "Thoth consumes the Ka."  One had a scroll and said "Thoth consumes sorcerous wisdom."  The last had a wand and read "Thoth consumes magic."  There was a door on the south wall, but it would not open, even to a lot of force.

Much discussion ensued.  Ioannes tried a Theology roll but didn't get much.  Vael tried a Hidden Lore: Magical Writings roll that told him the light and Ka ones were probably wrong and the wisdom and magic ones were probably right.  Touching the statues did nothing.  Dropping the scroll of Thothian prayers that they had just found into a hole didn't work, and they didn't get the scroll back.  Dropping a Continual Light rock into the hole of the statue with the wand caused a click from the door to the south.  It was unlocked!

They continued south into another small tomb, this one with a lot of Thothian bas-reliefs on the walls, and three sarcophagi, two of them fancier and one plainer.  The west wall had a mural of seven Thothian priests with the biggest labeled "Muirasso."  After a brief discussion, Vallium lifted the lid of the western sarcophagus, and undead started coming out of the walls...

We ran out of time there, and paused just before starting the combat.


GM's Comments:

The PCs helped Lady Alexia recover her ancestor's body, scouted out Plumthorn's gang with Wizard Eye, fought some more rats and small round demons, found that traps and teleporters don't always work as consistently as you'd like, found a new level, met Gog, met Dalton and a couple of his friends, and explored a hidden tomb until they opened the wrong sarcophagus and undead came out of the walls.  A pretty normal week.  Very light on treasure so far, but they're not done yet.


Achievements:

None


XP:

Incomplete, as they haven't made it back to town.  They've done significant exploration and found a little bit of loot, but they don't get credit for it until they make it out.  If they make it back next session, they'll get credit for all the exploration and loot across both sessions.


Next Week: 

For once, I can confidently say what they'll be doing at the start of the next session: fighting undead.  After that, I'm less sure, but I suspect that if they win, they'll try to finish looting the tomb, then try to find a way home.  And if they lose, they'll get to make new PCs.

# DFRPG Arden Vul Sessions 8b and 9: Muirasso's Tomb and the Broken Head

Date:

Demmasday, 2nd of Ligarios and Demmasday, 9th of Legarios, 2993 AEP


Weather:

Cool, cloudy


Player Characters:

Muirasso, wight, former cleric of Thoth
Many zombies
Piercer
Gog, varumani
Roskelly and several halfling toll collectors
Eggbert, Thorcin guard
Kronos Kettle-Belly, Thorcin innkeeper, Sign of the Broken Head
Estelle, Archontean innkeeper, Sign of the Broken Head
Crisarius Three-Legs, Archontean statue broker, Prosperity Factor
Fenitior Stone-Hands, Archontean statue broker, Wisdom Factor
Godric the Wise, Thorcin statue broker, Golden Band


The session began where the previous one paused, with Vallium pulling the lid off a sarcophagus in Muirasso's tomb.  The wight of Muirasso jumped out of the sarcophagus, holding a glowing broadsword, and attacked Vallium for disturbing his unrest.  Meanwhile, a couple of zombies emerged from the bas reliefs in the walls and charged other members of the party.  A long melee ensued, with additional zombies continually emerging from the walls.  Vael cast Grease on the floor, which caused the wight and several zombies to slip and fall.  Vallium stabbed the wight several times, while Michael and Uvash attacked zombies.  Ioannes cast Flaming Weapon and Shield, and Vael followed up with Blur.  Uvash started aiming at feet to knock down zombies that were still standing.  Eventually the wight was inactive and all the zombies were down, and whatever magic or curse had bound the zombies started failing and they lost their will to fight.

Ioannes cast Stop Bleeding on Michael to fix a minor wound, while the rest of the group looted the room.  They took the wight's glowing broadsword and a bunch of ancient silver and copper coins from his sarcophagus, plus a magic jug and a couple of flasks containing bright blue liquid.  Vallium knocked the lid off a second sarcophagus, and some green gas started pouring out.  Most of the group fled the room, while Vael cast Purify Air, which revealed that the gas was coming out of a canopic jar inside the sarcophagus.  Uvash ran into to put the crocodile-head lid back on the jar, which stopped the release of gas.  The third sarcophagus contained another gas-spewing canopic jar, which they handled the same way.

With all visible treasure taken, they searched for secret doors.  They found one in the southwest corner of the room, but could not open it.  Ioannes thought he found another one in the southeast corner, but everyone else thought it was just a line between bricks.  Stuck, Vael cast Seek Earth for gold, and though there was gold about six yards to the south.  They decided to go back to Gosterwick, then south to the dam.  Their padlock was still there, and when they unlocked it they found their wheelbarrow and tools still inside.  They discussed whether to leave the treasure in the dam house while they explored the ruins, or put it in the wheelbarrow and take it with them.  Ultimately they decided that having it stolen from the dam would be the worst outcome, so they put the treasure in a chest and put the chest in the wheelbarrow.

Vallium suggested exploring the northern island in the Swift River.  Michael pushed the wheelbarrrow as the group headed for the bridge to that island.  But when they got close to the bridge, they heard yelling from a tower to their north to stop, and someone shot a crossbow bolt over their head into the bridge.  They approached the tower, where a couple of armed men told them that there were deadly stone constructs on that island who would kill anyone who crossed the bridge, but fortunately the constructs did not leave the island.  Some discussion revealed that the leader's name was Eggbert, and that he worked for a man named Kronos who ran the Inn of the Broken Head, a bit to the northwest.

The group decided to visit the Inn, and followed Eggbert's directions to go west to the river.  Soon enough, they saw the Inn.  The Inn was a fortified two-story building, and there were several smaller outbuildings surrounding it.  There was the head of a large statue of Arden hanging above the front door, and both Vael and Ioannes thought the head looked magical.  Ioannes, Michael, and Lacrymosa stayed with the wheelbarrow, while Vael and Vallium went inside.

Inside the Inn was brightly lit by a couple of Continual Light rocks.  Kronos, a large Thorcin man, was behind the bar, with an Archontean woman named Estelle by his side.  They greeted the party and asked if they wanted beer or ale.  Vael bought a round for the group and carried some outside to the treasure guards, then started asking Kronos questions.  It turned out the Inn had three merchant factors in residence, all competing to buy statues looted from the ruins.  Vael mentioned they had some statues to sell, and within a couple minutes all three factors came rushing down the stairs: Crisarius Three-Legs from the Prosperity Factor, Fenitior Stone-Hands, from the Wisdom Factor, and Godric the Wise from the Golden Band.  Vael interrogated all three about their businesses and services available, and then went to get a couple of the gold shabti statues and said they were available to the highest bidder.  Lacrymosa came inside to help negotiate, and eventually Godric bought all three shabti statues in exchange for some valuable (and much lighter) gems.

Vael went outside and spent the time to cast Analyze Magic on the head of Arden, which revealed that it could speak if addressed respectfully.  He talked to the head and it told him "Restore me!  Courage shall be yours when I am whole and the incantation sung!"

Vael went back in, and he and and Kronos spent some more time asking each other questions.  Kronos revealed that the Forum of Set had an entrance on the west side of the cliff face, but it was considered dangerous.  Vael told Kronos about the bodies they had found on the roof of the tower by the Forum, and Kronos was pretty sure the two humans were his former employee Roger and "Roger's cousin", but had no idea who the halfling with them was.  He also revealed that they had found the head of Arden in the Forum by the oak tree, and had carried it over to the Inn to serve as their sign.  The group ultimately decided to head back to Gosterwick rather than staying at the Inn.  They made it back with their wheelbarrow full of treasure.


GM's Comments:

This was a complicated session.  One long combat against undead, then a lot of tomb raiding including a trip back to town to learn Lockmaster, and three different invisible bypasses of the halflings.  The group was pretty lucky that the piercer that achieved total surprise picked a hard target in Vallium.  Armor is good.  And they finally found the Inn of the Broken Head.


Achievements:

None


XP:

This was complicated, as they finished the previous delve this session, and then did another one.  With one PC swap between the two.

First delve:
Exploration: 10 new locations explored, good for 1 XP
Loot: Not that much, but it was enough for 1 XP
Second delve:
Exploration: 5 new locations explored, 1 XP
Loot: A massive haul, 2 XP

So those who were there for everything got 5 XP total.  Uvash was only there for the first delve and got 2 XP.  He did get a full cut of the treasure though, despite not helping haul it all out.


Next Week:

There was the usual smack talk about the halflings, but I'll believe it when I see it.  Kronos told them about another possible dungeon entrance to the Forum of Set, or maybe they'll try to explore more of Gog's level, or maybe they'll confuse me and try something completely different.
