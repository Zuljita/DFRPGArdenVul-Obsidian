# Adrienic Expedition

## Summary

A military expedition led by [[Archon Phocion IV]] approximately 250 years ago.

## History

The expedition was an attempt to retake [[Arden Vul]]. It was composed of six cohorts of legionaries: five from the "Sheepshead Rangers" and one from the emperor's own guards tagmata.

The expedition failed bloodily and all six cohorts were lost in a battle fought at the [[Cavern of Blood]], where their battle standards were also lost. The [[Haunted Tower]] at the base of the [[Waterfall]] was built during this expedition and abandoned when the survivors fled.

A rumor claims that the leader of the expedition, a certain "Adrienic" (presumably [[Archon Phocion IV]]), committed suicide rather than report his failure.

# Cult of Set

The Cult of Set is an ancient and officially banned religious group that worships the god [[Set]].

## The God Set
Set was a Greater God of the old pantheon (the Ten). He was the god of power, knowledge, domination, slavery, vengeance, and serpents.

## Follower Characteristics
The followers of Set, sometimes called Settites, are known for a few distinct characteristics:
- **Armor:** Red scale armor.
- **Weapons:** [[Was sticks]].
- **Creatures:** They use "[[Set animals]]", which are described as vicious dogs with square ears.

## History
Worship of Set was banned by imperial decree in 1839 AEP, over a thousand years ago. An organization known as the [[Drome]] claimed to have successfully eliminated the cult from the Empire shortly after the ban. Despite this, the cult persists.

## Activities & Lore
- **Slave Trade:** There are rumors that the [[Settite Guild of Service]] is a front for the cult's activities in buying and selling slaves.
- **Breeding Project:** An ancient text claims that the cult's temple in [[Arden Vul]] succeeded in a secret project to breed a fearsome species of animal that "shared all the attributes of Lord Set." This project was based in a secret cavern near the [[waterfall]].
- **Escaped Slaves:** A rumor was overheard in the [[Forum of Set]] where some of the red guardsmen were whispering about escaped slaves causing problems to the north. When questioned, they became officious and denied that anyone escapes the [[Settite Guild of Service]].
- **Antagonism towards "Right for Riches":** The cult has become a direct antagonist to the Right for Riches adventuring company. They are responsible for the murder of [[Susarra]] in [[Gosterwick]]. The cult's leader, the [[Pontifex]], has placed a bounty of $2,500 each on the heads of the entire party, with instructions to bring their remains to the [[Duty Deacon]] at the [[Forum of Set]] for payment.

## Known Locations
- [[Temple of Set]]
- [[Forum of Set]]

# Sortians

## Summary
The Sortians were a historical faction, now remembered as traitors, who instigated a civil war in 1698 AEP by rebelling against the established magical order.

## Beliefs and Practices
Led by [[Priscus Pulcher]], the Sortians believed that anyone with magical aptitude should be allowed to cast spells, challenging the control held by approved churches and colleges.

They were considered heretical for many reasons, including:
- Summoning demons.
- Allowing women and elves to hold leadership positions.
- Creating "graven images" in the form of magical statues of their leader for worship. Rituals involving these statues sometimes used magical eyes to achieve effects like passing messages or teleportation.

## History
The Sortians' rebellion against the established order led to a long and costly Civil War. The conflict is blamed for the abandonment of the [[Exarchate of Narsileon]] and setting the Empire back a thousand years.

Though the Empire survived with smaller borders and spell use was eventually opened up, the Sortians and their leader [[Priscus Pulcher]] (who was executed by an Exarch) are still considered traitors.

## Notes
- Information about them is found in the [[Book of Priors]] and in old books in the [[Library of Mitra]].
- Their leader, [[Priscus Pulcher]], is said to have resembled the statues known as "The Philosopher".
