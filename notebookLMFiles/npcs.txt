Along with her partner, Vul the Sorcerer, she discovered the cavern system that would become the Arden completed eleven of the "Twelve Labors," which involved defeating a host of formidable foes like owlbears, trolls, undead, dragons, and Wiskin berserkers. The twelfth labor is said to be "still to be done at the time of the Empire's Need."

At the peak of their power, both Arden and Vul mysteriously disappeared, and their bodies were never recovered. Some popular tales claim that Arden did not die but ascended to a state of demi-godhood, though official histories dispute this.

# Ethereum “Coinbase” Thuringwador

## Summary
Ethereum “Coinbase” Thuringwador is an elven illusionist and the leader of the Grudge Brigade mercenary company. Often described by the party as an "annoying elf," Coinbase is a relentless hustler and fixer, constantly trying to upsell clients on his "illusion-based tactical assistance system" or brokering deals. Despite his sometimes-abrasive salesmanship, he is a competent illusionist and a pragmatic, if self-serving, ally who has joined the Right for Riches Company on several delves.

## History & Interactions
Coinbase has been a recurring hired spellcaster for the Right for Riches Company, stepping in when the party's own mages are unavailable. His services, however, always come with a sales pitch.

His most significant non-combat interaction involved the Cult of Set. He received an anonymous contract offering a substantial reward for the death of the party members and Susarra. Rather than acting on it, Coinbase saw a better business opportunity and sold the information to Vael, providing the party with crucial intelligence about the threat against them (Tower of Scrutiny, it was Coinbase who wisely called for a tactical retreat when the party was overwhelmed by wraiths, a decision that likely saved them from a total party kill (Grudge Brigade:** As the head of the mercenary company, he manages contracts and deploys his subordinates.
- **Mercenary Illusionist:** Provides magical support for hire, specializing in illusion and utility spells like Levitation and Phantom.
- **Information Broker:** His position as a mercenary leader gives him access to the undercurrents of Gosterwick's adventurer economy, making him a valuable, if costly, source of information.

## Abilities
Coinbase has demonstrated a range of magical and combat abilities:
- **Illusion Magic:** He frequently uses a **Phantom** spell to create semi-real illusions that can assist in combat.
- **Utility Spells:** He is a frequent user of **Levitation** for transport and has also used **Lighten Burden**.
- **Combat:** While primarily a mage, he is not shy about entering melee, using his expensive **orichalcum shield** for both defense and offense (shield-bashing). He has been noted as being a particularly fast runner.
- **Negotiation:** He is a shrewd negotiator, always looking to maximize his profit, as seen in his dealings with the halfling toll collectors.

## Relationships
- **Right for Riches Company:** His primary clients. The relationship is purely business, though his timely advice has proven life-saving.
- **Cult of Set:** He was contracted by them to assassinate the party, but he betrayed the contract for a better offer from the party themselves.
- **Ashe "GOAT" Maykum:** He has promoted and attempted to sell the GOAT's inventions, such as the Living Wheelbarrow.

## Summary

## Disposition

# Demma

Demma, the "Great Nurturer," is a goddess of fertility, crops, households, childbirth, and magic. She is part of the new pantheon of gods, and the fifth day of the week, Demmasday, is named in her honor.

## Mythology
Ancient myths portray Demma as the one who sowed the first seeds of life and ensures the continuation of the cycles of growth, harvest, and renewal. It is said that she stole the secret of magic from the void and planted it within the soil and stars, granting mortals the ability to shape the world through wisdom and will.

Though her blessings are gentle, her wrath is unyielding. When her gifts are hoarded, abused, or defiled, she strikes with famine, blight, and barrenness. Her sacred weapon is the flail, symbolizing both the harvest and divine retribution. To understand her will is to understand the balance of nature, hearth, and spirit.

## Theology & Worship
The theology of Demma centers on balance, stewardship, and the sacred duty of cultivation—whether of land, family, or knowledge. Abundance is a gift given only to those who nurture it with wisdom and hard work. To act recklessly is to invite ruin, for Demma can withdraw her gifts as easily as she grants them.

Her followers are called to protect the cycles of nature, strengthen households, and guide new life. Magic is viewed as a seed of creation, a natural force to be cultivated responsibly. True wisdom is believed to come from action, not just study. Worshipers often bring offerings of seeds, bread, and woven charms to honor her blessings.

## The Priesthood of Demma
The priesthood is hierarchical yet practical, structured to emphasize stewardship and active service.

### Clergy and Vestments
The standard attire for Demma's clergy consists of a long tunic in earthy tones (deep greens, golden yellows, or rich browns) with seed-like embroidery. Over this, they wear a sleeveless outer robe in deep red or russet. A broad, gold-threaded sash is worn at the waist, often adorned with woven charms, seed pouches, or small flail-shaped talismans. For ceremonial occasions, priests may don a hooded cloak fastened with a brooch shaped like a seed.

The vestments are designed to be practical for work, reinforcing the belief that faith is meant to be lived, not just displayed.

### Branches of the Faith
- **Seedkeepers:** A scholarly, more esoteric branch of the priesthood. They guard ancient agricultural knowledge, sacred fertility rites, and study the interplay between magic and the natural world.
- **Harvest Guardians:** The dedicated warrior arm of the faith. They defend temples and enforce Demma's will, wielding the flail. Each major temple typically has a contingent of six to twelve fighters.

## Notable Followers
- **Ioannes Grammatikos Byzantios:** A player character and a scholarly, Archontean cleric of Demma. His personal attire is slightly more ornate than that of the rural clergy, reflecting his broader understanding of Demma's role in magic and wisdom.
- **Vivian:** The stern but fair Thorcin chief priest of the Temple of Demma in Gosterwick. He is capable of casting powerful spells, such as Remove Curse.

## Associated Locations
- **Temple of Demma:** The temple in Gosterwick is a modest but well-maintained structure that serves as a center for healing and rural devotion. It is a frequent destination for the Right for Riches Company to receive healing and find refuge for those they rescue.
- **Demmasday Market:** The central market in Gosterwick is held on Totsday and all of Demmasday, with the latter being the biggest market of the week.

## History & Key Events
Demma's influence is felt frequently in the party's adventures, primarily through her cleric, Ioannes. The Temple in Gosterwick has proven to be a crucial resource, providing vital services like curse removal on multiple occasions.

An early incident at the Yellow Cloak Inn, where an accidental Continual Darkness spell was cast on some bedsheets, resulted in clerics of Demma being forbidden from casting spells on the premises. The party also regularly visits the Demmasday market in town to procure supplies.

# Ibis

## Appears In
- Session 6 - Good Ghost, Bad Ghost

## History
- Session 1 - First Visit to the Ruins of Arden Vul — He saw a room with a large statue of an 8' tall ibis head in the center, and three relatively recent corpses on the floor, two humans in scale armor with shortswords and one halfling in leather armor that Vael's magery detected as magical.
  - Session 1 - First Visit to the Ruins of Arden Vul — In addition to the ibis head statue and the corpses, the top floor also featured a couple of wooden stairways down, but only the first few feet of each stairway was visible before things got dark with a suspiciously sharp cutoff.
- Session 2 - Halfling Rent-Seekers — There stood a 20' tall statue of Thoth in Ibis-headed form, with a body of purple porphyry stone and a head of white marble, with eyes of green jade.
  - Session 2 - Halfling Rent-Seekers — The walls were lined with sixteen pictures of ibis heads all looking at the same point in the center of the floor, but there was nothing interesting at that point.
- Session 3 - Dragons and Baboons and Beastmen, Oh My! — Ioannes went down the stairs alone a bit, and saw that these stairs were much less worn than the other ones, that there were pictures of various animals (hippo, crocodile, ibis, baboon, giraffe) on the front of the stairs, and that there...
  - Session 3 - Dragons and Baboons and Beastmen, Oh My! — Michael wiped the soot off the niche plug and found both an image of ibis-headed Thoth with his left arm forward and his right arm down, and a sigil of a tower with light shining out of one window.
- Session 4 - Cheese and Crackers and Thoth and Demons — # DFRPG Arden Vul.md|Arden Vul]] Session 4: Cheese and Crackers and Thoth and Demons Date: Demmasday, 5th of Lucrios, 2993 AEP Weather: Cool, overcast, rainy Player Characters: Ioannes Grammatikos Byzantios, Archontean cleric of Demma (Demented Avenger...
  - Session 4 - Cheese and Crackers and Thoth and Demons — After a few minutes of rest, a flying stone gargoyle with the head of an ibis swooped down to attack.
- Session 6 - Good Ghost, Bad Ghost — Ashe Maykum thought the stars were the constellation of the Ibis, but the others were less sure.
- Session 19 - The Pool of Donkey Ears — Dundee, Thorcin barbarian (Adam) Uvash Edzuson, Dwarven cleric of Zodarrim (Cosmo) Vael Sunshadow, Half-Elven mage (Kyle) Vallium Halcyon, Archontean fighter (Greybrown) Ethereum "Coinbase" Thuringwador, Elf Illusionist (Mercenary) (Arch...
  - Session 19 - The Pool of Donkey Ears — Another position caused a secret door on the east wall to open, and an angry ibis-headed construct of Thoth came out to attack.
- Session 22 - Oracle of Thoth and The Litany of Light.md|The Oracle of Thoth and The Litany of Light]] — Skeleton cook Flaming skull Animated bust of Stamelis, Librarian of Thoth 2 Ibis constructs of Thoth Ioannes did some research on the copy of the Litany of Light they had found in Library o...

- Session 23a - Gelatinous Cube and Slime Kraken — There was some anti-Thoth graffiti on the walls, and a picture of a crocodile eating an ibis, indicating that the vandalism was probably the work of Set.md|Cult of Set]].
- Session 24b - The Set Cult Strikes Back, Larel's Stuff, and the Shrines.md|Hall of Shrines]] — Dundee, Thorcin barbarian (Adam) Uvash Edzuson, Dwarven cleric of Zodarrim (Cosmo) Significant NPCs: Many Set guards Several Set acolytes Several Set sergeants Some Set Guild of Service fighters
  - Session 24b - The Set Cult Strikes Back, Larel's Stuff, and the Shrines.md|Hall of Shrines]] — Two positions each caused a secret door to open and an ibis-headed Guardian of Thoth to emerge to attack them, but the fights were five on one and the Guardians were not that hard to defeat.
- Session 27 - Tomb of Ptoh-Ristus.md|The Tomb of Ptoh-Ristus]] — There was a big chest full of ancient coins, a matched pair of magic rugs, a bunch of alabaster vases and a silver ibis and a golden feather, a cleric scroll with a previously unknown and powerful spell to raise the sanctity level of an ...
- Session 29 - The Tower of Scrutiny — Vallium then borrowed the Ring of Climbing from Uvash, tied a rope around his waist, wrapped the rope around the ibis-head statue, and had Uvash hold onto the other end of the rope.
  - Session 29 - The Tower of Scrutiny — The giant ibis-headed Thoth statue was wearing a pink turban, sort of resembling the one Weskenim.md|Weskenim]] wore.
- Session 31 - I Want to Believe — Once again they searched for secret doors, and this time Vael spotted an ibis fresco on the north wall that looked suspicious, with a slot in its beak.

# Merenuithiel Merenuithiel Lacrymosa Armaris

## Summary
Merenuithiel "Merenuithiel Lacrymosa Armaris.md|Merenuithiel Lacrymosa Merenuithiel Lacrymosa Armaris]]" Merenuithiel Lacrymosa Armaris is a skilled but notoriously aggressive Elven mercenary archer, frequently hired by the Right for Riches Company from the Grudge Brigade. She serves as recurring ranged support and is known for her deadly efficiency in combat and a relentless desire to confront and kill halflings.

## Personality and Reputation
Merenuithiel Lacrymosa Armaris.md|Merenuithiel Lacrymosa Merenuithiel Lacrymosa Armaris]] has earned a reputation for being "bloodthirsty." She is single-minded in her goals, tirelessly advocating for aggressive solutions and showing no hesitation in combat. This was most evident in her brutal efficiency during the assault on Plumthorn's gang, where she killed stunned, fleeing, or surrendering enemies without pause.

Despite her aggression, she can be a team player, participating in planning and negotiations. She has also shown a moment of humility, apologizing after her recklessness led to her being incapacitated during a fight with stirges.

Her defining character trait is a deep-seated animosity towards the extortionist halflings of Phlebotomas Plumthorn, a topic she raises almost every time she is hired.

Her nickname "Merenuithiel Lacrymosa Armaris.md|Merenuithiel Lacrymosa Merenuithiel Lacrymosa Armaris]]" is derived from her elven grace and deadly accuracy with a bow, evoking a sense of solemn beauty.

## First Appearance
Session 4 - Cheese and Crackers and Thoth and Demons

## Notable Actions
Merenuithiel Lacrymosa Armaris.md|Merenuithiel Lacrymosa Merenuithiel Lacrymosa Armaris]] has been involved in numerous operations with the party, often turning the tide of difficult fights.

- **First Hiring (Session 4):** First hired from the Grudge Brigade, she aided the party in exploring a section of the Pyramid of Thoth, fighting off demons and flying jellyfish-like creatures. She was already advocating for fighting the halflings.
- **Negotiations at the Inn (Session 8b & 9):** She assisted the party in negotiating the sale of three gold shabti statues to merchant factors at the Sign of the Broken Head.
- **The Great Cavern (Session 15):** During a return to the Great Cavern, she accidentally shot Vallium in the back. Later, she was swarmed by stirges and knocked unconscious after acting alone, for which she apologized. She also served as a makeshift boat captain for the party.
- **Well of Light (Session 22):** Hired again, she immediately asked if it was "time to kill the halflings yet." She helped clear a room of ghouls and fought animated ibis statues, but did not take part in the spiritual "Litany of Light" ritual.
- **The Halfling Takedown (Session 26):** Merenuithiel Lacrymosa Armaris.md|Merenuithiel Lacrymosa Merenuithiel Lacrymosa Armaris]] was instrumental in the successful ambush of Plumthorn's halfling gang. Using potions and a Concussion spell, she neutralized and killed numerous halflings, including the leader Blandveg and a fleeing Roskelly Winterleaf. Her brutal efficiency was a key factor in the encounter.
- **Official Recognition (Session 32):** For her role in the "Great Reconquest of Upper Goblintown," she was officially recognized by King Weskenim and awarded a patch naming her a "**Halfling Slayer**."

# Phlebotomas Plumthorn.md|Phlebotomas Phlebotomas Plumthorn]]

## Summary
Phlebotomas Plumthorn.md|Phlebotomas Phlebotomas Plumthorn]] was the halfling mob boss who ran an extortion racket near the pyramid landings under Arden Vul. For a long time, he and his gang of thugs controlled access to the Halls of Thoth, demanding payment from all who passed. His operation was ultimately dismantled by the Right for Riches Company in a decisive assault.

## Criminal Enterprise
Phlebotomas Plumthorn's gang controlled the territory beneath the Pyramid of Thoth. His business model involved:
- **"Adventuring Licenses":** Forcing adventurers to purchase a license for 25 gp to enter the area.
- **Tithing:** Demanding a 10% tithe on all treasure recovered by licensed parties.
- **Protection Racket:** Extending his influence beyond the ruins, running a protection racket for merchants as far away as Newmarket.
- **Armed Enforcement:** His gang was known to be well-armed, reportedly using magic wands and poison.

## Relationships
- **Roskelly Winterleaf:** Phlebotomas Plumthorn's primary lieutenant, responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of the toll collection. He was killed by Lacrymosa while attempting to flee during the party's final assault.
- **Blandveg:** An Archontean mage, alchemist, and poisoner who worked with the halflings. He was also killed by Lacrymosa.
- **King Weskenim:** A significant rival. Phlebotomas Plumthorn's gang was squatting on territory that Weskenim considered a rightful goblin entrance to the surface. The goblin king encouraged the party to act as "halfling exterminators."
- **Right for Riches Company:** Phlebotomas Plumthorn's relationship with the party was fraught with tension from their first meeting. The constant tolls and harassment were a recurring point of frustration, eventually leading to his downfall.

## The Downfall
After numerous sessions of debate and planning, the Right for Riches Company finally moved against Phlebotomas Plumthorn in **Session 26**.
- **The Plan:** Aided by the mercenary Lacrymosa, the party used a combination of flight and invisibility spells to bypass Phlebotomas Plumthorn's guards and strike directly at the leadership.
- **The Assault:** The ambush was a resounding success. Merenuithiel Lacrymosa Armaris.md|Merenuithiel Lacrymosa Merenuithiel Lacrymosa Armaris]] killed Blandveg almost immediately. Phlebotomas Plumthorn was quickly wounded and, after a successful intimidation by Vael, was forced to surrender.
- **The Aftermath:** Phlebotomas Plumthorn was stripped of his possessions, including his keys, which were later copied and given to the goblins. He and his surviving followers were exiled from Arden Vul and instructed to return to Newmarket under threat of death. His former territory was then ceded to King Weskenim's goblins.

# Ptarmis

## Summary
Mysterious Thoth‑aligned wizard tied to the fungal caverns near the Session 5 - Parleys and The Great Cavern
- Session 6 - Good Ghost, Bad Ghost
- Session 30 - The Tomb of Theskalon

## Roles & Influence
- Claimed “master of the cavern”; rumored to direct or bargain with the Session 5 - Parleys and The Great Cavern — # DFRPG Arden Vul.md|Arden Vul]] Session 5: Parleys and The Great Cavern Date: Demmasday, 11th of Lucrios, 2993 AEP Weather: Cool, overcast, rainy Player Char...
  - Session 5 - Parleys and The Great Cavern — The man identified himself as Ptarmis, the master of the cavern.
- Session 6 - Good Ghost, Bad Ghost — Vallium again tried finding rumors about Phlebotomas Plumthorn's halfling gang in various drinking establishments, and instead heard something about Ptarmis, a wizard who lived in the fungal caverns.
- Session 25 - Looking for the Back Door to the Forum of Set — The lead forester talked about how cool Ptarmis was and how much he liked the living wheelbarrow and asked if they were friends of Ptarmis.
  - Session 25 - Looking for the Back Door to the Forum of Set — Vael indicated that they were also friends of Ptarmis and asked if the foresters had a source of cloud cap mushrooms.
- Session 30 - The Tomb of Theskalon — There was a Mithric inscription on the sarcophagus: Here rests Ptarmis loyal servant of Thoth seeker of hidden ways who destroyed the loathsome ones raised his children from spores and opened this cavern Those who disturb his sleep Will ...
  - Session 30 - The Tomb of Theskalon — This was a bit confusing, since they'd met a man named Ptarmis, on the throne a bit to the east, who was very much alive.

## Notes

- A found note claims that Ptarmis can control the Ptarmis as a famous Thothian priest from the early days of Ptarmis is credited with discovering the Ptarmis who is currently alive.
- A sarcophagus has been found with an inscription for a "Ptarmis loyal servant of Thoth."
- **Rumor:** A rumor states that the great Thothian wizard Ptarmis built a secret tomb for himself amid a huge forest of colossal mushrooms on the second level from the surface. The explorers who found the cavern were driven back by Sheep-headed Critters.

## Hook
A name shared across centuries: hermit wizard or the echo of a Thothian master?

# Weskenim.md|Weskenim]]

## Summary
Weskenim is the ambitious and pragmatic ruler of the United Goblins, styling himself as their Grand King. From his court in Goblintown, he presides over a growing territory that includes the Wet Caves and the repurposed "Glory of Weskenim" (formerly the Glory of Thoth). While he projects authority through a network of sub-chiefs and sergeants, his rule is not universally accepted among all goblins, with some outlying groups openly disparaging him. He is known for his distinctive pink turban and his fondness for his pet cat, which can sometimes distract him from matters of state.

## History & Interactions
Weskenim.md|Weskenim]]'s relationship with the Right for Riches Company began in earnest after they rescued his brother, Gribble, from the clutches of the Cult of Set (Weskenim was the occupation of what he considered goblin territory by Phlebotomas Plumthorn's halfling gang. He enlisted the Right for Riches Company as "halfling exterminators" to deal with this problem. Upon the party's success in ousting Phlebotomas Plumthorn (Weskenim rewarded them with a large perfect diamond, a suit of human-sized magical scale armor from an ancient goblin king, and free passage through goblin lands. Several party members were also awarded "Halfling Slayer" patches, created by the goblin artist Temrin.

Weskenim is keenly interested in recovering the legendary **Scepter of the Goblins**, which he believes is key to unifying all goblin clans under his rule. He has promised the adventurers a further reward for its retrieval, though he dismisses the goblin mystic Gislu, who also seeks it, as a "fake."

He maintains a court with a major-domo named Palestrim and advisors like Skimmel and Reeflik. He has shown a degree of political cunning, deliberately delaying an audience with a group of mysterious wizards he suspected were hostile to the Varumani, whom he wishes to avoid conflict with.

## Roles & Influence
- **Goblin Unifier:** Aspires to unite all goblin clans under his banner.
- **Territorial Expansion:** Actively works to expand goblin-controlled areas within Arden Vul.
- **Key Quest Giver:** Has tasked the Right for Riches Company with recovering the Scepter of the Goblins.
 - **Faction Leader:** Commands a significant military force, including ogre guards and numerous goblin warriors led by officers like Killik and Bottleneck.

## Relationships
- **Gribble:** His brother. Gribble's rescue from a Set prison was the catalyst for Weskenim's alliance with the party.
- **Phlebotomas Plumthorn:** A major rival whose expulsion from the Halls was a key victory for Weskenim, secured with the party's help.
- **Right for Riches Company:** A key, if sometimes transactional, ally. He has rewarded them for their services and relies on them for important tasks.
- **Palestrim:** His major-domo, responsible for managing the royal court.
- **Bottleneck:** His Master Sergeant in Upper Goblintown.
- **Killik:** The "Big Boss" of the Wet Caves, who reports directly to Weskenim.
- **Sir Sorrow:** A Sun-Scarred Knight who was a guest in his court for a time.
- **Gislu:** A rival for power who claims to be a mystic; Weskenim considers him a fraud.

## Notes
- Some goblins, particularly a splinter group living with baboons, hold a negative view of his rule, stating "Weskenim.md|Weskenim]] sucked."
- He has a harem, from which he was emerging when the party arrived to report on their victory over the halflings.
- The goblin artist Weskenim and Gribble.
