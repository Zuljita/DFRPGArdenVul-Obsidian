# Gosterwick

Gosterwick is a rapidly growing "boom town" located about 10 miles south of the ruins of Arden Vul.

## History & Layout
Originally a tiny Thorcin farming village, Gosterwick's expansion began approximately 20 years ago when the Archontean noblewoman Lady Alexia Basileon arrived along with a contingent of Knights of the Azure Shield and built the Azure Keep. The settlement then began to grow into a town of a couple thousand people. The Azure Keep is located in the northeast corner of the town by a lake.

The town's walls are not yet complete, consisting mostly of a marked-out dirt berm with two finished gatehouses. Most of the buildings are clustered in the northeast corner near the keep. To compensate for the lack of walls, large wooden guard houses have been erected in the emptier parts of town.

## Services & Points of Interest

Gosterwick offers a surprising number of services for its size, attracting adventurers and others seeking to make their fortune from the nearby ruins.

### Inns & Taverns
- **Inns:**
    - Yellow Cloak Inn: Good quality at a reasonable price. Frequented by adventurers.

    - Grinning Skull
    - Muddy Puddle

- **Tailor:** Tasha's Tailor Shop, where custom embroidered patches can be commissioned.
- **Bookseller:** Astabelon's Bookstore, which carries a variety of reference books.
- **Other:** A pawn shop and a money changer are also present.

### Factions & Factors
- Arcane Practitioners' Club: A magical society with a clubhouse deliberately isolated from other buildings.
- **Merchant Factors:** The Rarities Factor, Prosperity Factor, and Silent Factor all have a presence.

### Temples & Shrines
- Temple of Demma: A modest, well-maintained temple led by Chief Priest Vivian.

## History
- Session 4 - Cheese and Crackers and Thoth and Demons — Achievements: Iconic Location: The Great Hall Iconic Location: The Great Chasm Thus Spake Thoth: All clerics talk to gods.
- Session 6 - Good Ghost, Bad Ghost — There were open double doors to the southwest, facing the Great Chasm.
- Session 7 - Why Did It Have to Be Plants? — Here's a shortened version: 2 caves behind the Waterfall (beneath 35-40' of rough water) Ruined tower near the base of the Waterfall (ghost) Secret entrance 2/3 of the way up the lo...
- Session 8a - Never Trust a Scorpion — The eye went east first, and found a room containing a halfling sitting on a bedroll reading and writing letters, two more halflings guarding an entrance to the Great Chasm in the northeast of the room, and a human man taking some notes.
  - Session 8a - Never Trust a Scorpion — Once again there was access to the Great Chasm, and two halflings were guarding it.

- Session 19 - The Pool of Donkey Ears — Everyone listened at it, then they opened it and found a room bisected by the Great Chasm, with a narrow bridge crossing it.

- Session 27 - The Tomb of Ptoh-Ristus — Vael then cast Walk on Air on everyone, and everyone flew back across the Great Chasm to the west and searched the rooms there.
- Session 28 - Teleport Rugs and Baboons — The sarcophagus was empty, but there was a bridge over the Great Chasm (which was pretty narrow here) further east.
- Session 32 - Fast Exploration — Vael asked Hal if that chasm was The Great Chasm, and Hal said he didn't go into the chasm because it wasn't safe, but he'd heard they were connected.
  - Session 32 - Fast Exploration — They continued west down a wide passage, past a statue of a four-armed monster and a statue of a Rudishva (who welcomed visitors to the Arena in Archontean, Varumani, and Rudishva), past some magical darkness, and finally west to the Gre...

# Haunted Tower

## Description
A tower located at the base of the Waterfall near Arden Vul.

## History
The tower was built during the Adrienic Expedition, an attempt by Archon Phocion IV to retake Arden Vul about 250 years ago. The expedition failed bloodily, and the tower was abandoned.

## Inhabitants
- The Tower Ghost: The tower is haunted by an angry, wronged soul that screams of "Settite murderers."

## Notes

### From the Journal of Ioannes
> I found the record. The tower at the base of the waterfall—built during the Adrienic Expedition, two and a half centuries past. An attempt by Archon Phocion IV to retake Arden Vul. It failed. Bloodily. The tower was left behind when the survivors fled.
> And now it is haunted. Or rather, “folklore,” according to one too-convenient source.
>
> I do not trust him. He either never saw the ghost himself, or pretended not to.
>
> I did. The spirit that emerged from that cellar did not wander aimlessly or mutter incoherently. It screamed—accused. “Settite murderers,” it said. That is not a random haunt. That is a wronged soul. It is bound, and it is angry.
>
> This is not folklore. This is unfinished business.
>
> Demma teaches that proper rest follows proper ritual. Perhaps there is something to uncover: a hidden corpse, a desecrated relic, an oath unfulfilled. I will return. Not yet. But soon. And I will put it to rest.
>
> Gods grant that it is no demon. If it is, I will not face it alone.

  - Session 28 - Teleport Rugs and Baboons — Trefko said that he hadn't been the one pooping on the mirror, but he didn't want to live in the Howling Caves because there were too many young baboons there and they were too loud.
- Session 29 - The Tower of Scrutiny — Explore the Howling Caves beyond the portcullis.
  - Session 29 - The Tower of Scrutiny — Yamki gave some of the meat to each of the nearby female baboons, then headed south to the Howling Caves to feed the others.

# Shrine of Lucreon

## Summary
A shrine to the god Lucreon in Gosterwick.

## Description
The shrine is a classic, three-chamber structure: an ante-cella for congregation, a cella for main rituals, and an unconnected postern with administrative offices and clergy apartments.

The main cultic object is a colossal granite statue of Lucreon, dressed as an Archontean factor associate, holding a massive bag of coins. An offering chest sits below the bag.

## The Mystery of Lucreon
The shrine is home to an impressive mystery: when a coin is dropped into the offering box, it magically appears in the air above the statue and falls into the god's money bag. The bag is emptied by the clerics each night.
