The GM decided to run a fantasy megadungeon campaign using "The Halls of Arden Vul.md|Arden Vul]]" by Richard Barton, written for OSRIC (a variant of Advanced D&D First Edition). The adventure is noted for its huge size (1100+ pages), a well-developed world, and a challenging dungeon.

- **Disadvantage Limit:** -25 points.
- **Sense of Duty (Adventuring Companions):** [-5] does not count against the disadvantage limit.

# Arden Vul.md|Arden Vul]] Character Creation Rules (2025-03-06)

This document outlines the specific rules for character creation in the DFRPG Arden Vul.md|Arden Vul]] campaign, building upon the Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game (DFRPG) base rules.

## Core Character Generation
- **Base System:** Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game (DFRPG) is the base rules set. Anything from the rest of GURPS requires GM approval.
- **Starting Points:** 125 points.
- **Disadvantage Limit:** -25 points.
- **Sense of Duty (Adventuring Companions) [-5]:** This specific disadvantage does not count against the limit.
- **Quirk Limit:** -5 points.

## "Five Easy Pieces" Template System
- **Method:** Uses the "Five Easy Pieces" character generation option from Pyramid 3/113 (also available in GCS).
- **Mini-Templates:** Consists of 50-point mini-templates.
- **Affordability:** With the given point budget (125 + 25 + 5 + 5 = 160 points effective), PCs can typically afford three 50-point "Pieces," or two if an expensive racial template is chosen.
- **Disadvantage Points:** Disadvantage points embedded within a Piece *do* count against the overall disadvantage limit.
- **Leftover Points:** Any remaining points can be spent on abilities within the chosen Pieces, or on general abilities not restricted to specific templates in DFRPG.
    - Most attributes, skills, and advantages are generally purchasable by any character.
    - Some abilities are reserved for specific templates (e.g., Halfling Marksmanship for Set rules in GCS).

## Equipment and Economy

- **Starting Equipment:** Per DFRPG rules. Can buy Arden Vul.md|Arden Vul]] Equipment.

## Perks

- **Burdock's Valley Local [1]:** A new perk. If taken, the PC has lived in the Burdock's Valley area long enough to gain extra rumors, an area map, and default Area Knowledge. PCs without this perk arrive as outsiders and must ask NPCs for directions.

# Arden Vul.md|Arden Vul]]: The Archontean Calendar (2025-03-08)

This document describes the structure and unique characteristics of the Archontean Calendar, as it functions within the Magae world setting of Arden Vul.

## Calendar Structure

-   **Months:** 12 months, each with exactly 30 days.
-   **Year Length:** The year on Magae is 372 days (compared to Earth's 365/365.25 days).
-   **Intercalary Periods:** To account for the 372-day year, two 6-day intercalary periods are added:
    -   **Mercedonian Days (Days of Wages):** Occurs right after the New Year.
    -   **Voluptarian Days (Days of Pleasure):** Occurs two-thirds of the way through the year, between the eighth and ninth month, coinciding with the harvest festival. This asymmetrical placement makes "faux-historical sense" given typical harvest times.

## Days of the Week

The week consists of seven days, each named after a deity or celestial body:

-   **Basilsday:** Named for the Emperor.
-   **Lunday:** Named for the Moon.
-   **Tothsday:** Named for Thoth (a Greater God of the old pantheon, no longer popular).
-   **Mitrasday:** Named for Mitra (a god of the new pantheon).
-   **Tahsday:** Named for Ptah (a god of the old pantheon).
-   **Horasday:** Named for Horus (a god of the old pantheon, unpopular and possibly dead).
-   **Demmasday:** Named for Demma (a goddess of the new pantheon).

## Translation and GM Notes

-   The different year lengths and intercalary periods complicate direct translation between real-world and game-world calendars.
-   The GM typically "wings it" by syncing game seasons with real seasons and using real-world weather analogs.
-   Dates are primarily used for seasonal weather and tracking weekly game progression (as PCs usually delve once a week).
-   The "silly jumble of historical accidents" in the calendar, particularly the inconsistent naming of days, is noted as a realistic touch for a fictional world.

# Ioannes' Journal - The Tower Ghost

## Demmasday, 25th of Lucrios, 2993 AEP

### The Tower Ghost

I found the record. The tower at the base of the tower was left behind when the survivors fled.
And now it is haunted. Or rather, “folklore,” according to one too-convenient source.

I do not trust him. He either never saw the ghost himself, or pretended not to.

I did. The spirit that emerged from that cellar did not wander aimlessly or mutter incoherently. It screamed—accused. “Settite murderers,” it said. That is not a random haunt. That is a wronged soul. It is bound, and it is angry.

This is not folklore. This is unfinished business.

Demma teaches that proper rest follows proper ritual. Perhaps there is something to uncover: a hidden corpse, a desecrated relic, an oath unfulfilled. I will return. Not yet. But soon. And I will put it to rest.

Gods grant that it is no demon. If it is, I will not face it alone.

Akla-Chah explained that the Rudishva have a few different funeral traditions, ranked by preference:

1.  **Full Recycling:**
    -   Considered the best method.
    -   The Beacon currently lacks the ability to perform this.
2.  **Spacing:**
    -   The second-best method.
    -   The Beacon currently lacks the ability to perform this either.
3.  **Cremation:**
    -   The third-best method.
    -   Might be practical if the party has the means to build a suitably hot fire, somewhere outside the Beacon.

Among their "sins" were:
- Summoning Empire survived, albeit with smaller borders.
- Spell use was eventually opened up.
- Some old churches lost power, and new ones took their place.
- Priscus Pulcher and the Sortians are still remembered as traitors, though many are unclear on the specifics.

## The Philosopher Statue

- The "Philosopher" is a generic figure.
- Priscus Pulcher was an actual historical figure.
- He did look similar to "The Philosopher" later in his life, but it's unclear which came first.
