# Announcing DFRPG Arden Vul (2025-03-05)

## Campaign Overview

The GM decided to run a fantasy megadungeon campaign using "The Halls of Arden Vul" by Richard Barton, written for OSRIC (a variant of Advanced D&D First Edition). The adventure is noted for its huge size (1100+ pages), a well-developed world, and a challenging dungeon.

The campaign uses the Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game (DFRPG) as its base rule set, with specific modifications to character generation and experience point (XP) awards.

## Character Creation Rules (Summary)

- **Point Total:** 125 points for player characters (PCs).
- **Disadvantage Limit:** -25 points.
- **Sense of Duty (Adventuring Companions):** [-5] does not count against the disadvantage limit.
- **Quirk Limit:** -5 points.
- **Templates:** Uses "Five Easy Pieces" from Pyramid 3/113, which are 50-point mini-templates. PCs can afford three Pieces (or two with an expensive racial template). Disadvantage points embedded in a Piece count against the limit.
- **Playable Races:** Dwarves, Elves, Half-elves, Halflings, Humans, and Imperial Goblins. Cat-folk, half-orcs, half-ogres, and gnomes are not allowed.
- **Languages:** Languages can be taken at Accented and Broken levels to save points.
- **Starting Money:** Per DFRPG rules, with options to buy Wealth or trade points for cash.
- **Equipment:** Standard DFRPG: Adventurers equipment is available at list price, except for plate armor (which does not exist in the setting). Some non-magical items can be requested from the GM. Special orders or magical equipment may require availability rolls or travel to larger cities.
- **Coinage:** Uses AD&D coin value ratios with a silver piece standard ($1 = 1 silver piece). A copper is $0.1, a gold is $10, and a platinum is $50.
- **Perks:** "Burdock's Valley Local" [1] grants extra rumors, an area map, and default Area Knowledge for the local area.

## Setting Introduction

-   **World Name:** Magae.
-   **Major Power:** The Archontean Empire.
-   **Historical Context:** The old Archontean Empire (analogous to ancient Rome) expanded across nearby islands and parts of Irthuin. 1200 years ago, a magical civil war led survivors to retreat to the home island of Mithruin. The current empire (analogous to Byzantium) is re-occupying old territories. Arden Vul was a frontier city destroyed in this civil war.
-   **Local Geography:** The play area is Burdock's Valley (90x80 miles), containing Arden Vul, Gosterwick (half-day's march south of Arden Vul), Newmarket (3 days further south), six small villages, and a couple of castles. Most inhabitants are Thorcin.

## Cultures

-   **Archonteans**: Rulers of the empire, Byzantine feel.
-   **Thorcin**: Local population in Irthuin, conquered then independent, now conquered again.
-   **Wiskin**: Vikings from northern islands.
-   **Khumus**: Horse nomads from far to the west.
-   **Halflings & Imperial Goblins**: Assimilated into the Archontean Empire, though goblins are second-class citizens.
-   **Elves & Dwarves**: Independent, secretive kingdoms outside the Empire.

## Languages

- **Commonly Spoken Near Arden Vul**: Archontean (urban/ruling class) and Thorcin (rural/working class).
- **Ancient Archontean:** Mithric (dead as a native language, but used for magic, religion, and scholarship). Spellbooks and scrolls are written in Mithric.
- **Racial Languages:** Elvish, Dwarvish.

## Religion

- **Archontean Pantheon**: Ten major gods and seventeen minor gods.
- **Gosterwick Temples (Full Clerics):**
    - Demma (goddess of fertility and crops)
    - Heschius Ban (god of power)
    - Lucreon (god of wealth and merchants)
    - Mitra (god of justice and contracts)
- **Other Deities:** Small shrines to other Archontean major/minor gods and Thorcin gods in Gosterwick. Newmarket has temples to all ten major Archontean gods, several minor ones, most of the Thorcin pantheon, and the Wiskin god Odin.
- **Proscribed Gods:** Set (illegal worship), Horus (presumed dead, no spells for clerics).
- **Dwarves**: Monotheists.
- **Elves**: "Spiritual but not religious," lack clerics.

## Game Mechanics & GM Notes

- **Mana:** Normal mana area.
- **Magic:** Well known, studied, and regulated by colleges.
- **Logistics:** Weekly game (Friday nights, 8 PM-midnight NA Eastern Time). 4-5 players. PCs encouraged to return to safe places weekly; points awarded/spent only in safe places.
- **Software:** Foundry VTT, GCS, Discord. Voice game requires a microphone.
- **Spoilers:** Strict "no spoilers" policy for players who have read "The Halls of Arden Vul" or watched actual plays.
- **Difficulty:** Hard adventure, caution needed. Experience with fantasy RPGs recommended; new GURPS players advised to avoid spellcasters initially.

# Arden Vul Character Creation Rules (2025-03-06)

This document outlines the specific rules for character creation in the DFRPG Arden Vul campaign, building upon the Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game (DFRPG) base rules.

## Core Character Generation
- **Base System:** Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game (DFRPG) is the base rules set. Anything from the rest of GURPS requires GM approval.
- **Starting Points:** 125 points.
- **Disadvantage Limit:** -25 points.
- **Sense of Duty (Adventuring Companions) [-5]:** This specific disadvantage does not count against the limit.
- **Quirk Limit:** -5 points.

## "Five Easy Pieces" Template System
- **Method:** Uses the "Five Easy Pieces" character generation option from Pyramid 3/113 (also available in GCS).
- **Mini-Templates:** Consists of 50-point mini-templates.
- **Affordability:** With the given point budget (125 + 25 + 5 + 5 = 160 points effective), PCs can typically afford three 50-point "Pieces," or two if an expensive racial template is chosen.
- **Disadvantage Points:** Disadvantage points embedded within a Piece *do* count against the overall disadvantage limit.
- **Leftover Points:** Any remaining points can be spent on abilities within the chosen Pieces, or on general abilities not restricted to specific templates in DFRPG.
    - Most attributes, skills, and advantages are generally purchasable by any character.
    - Some abilities are reserved for specific templates (e.g., Halfling Marksmanship for Halflings, Turning for Clerics). Players are advised to ask the GM if unsure.

## Playable Races and Languages

- **Available Racial Templates:** Dwarf, Elf, Half-Elf, Halfling, Human, and Imperial Goblin.
- **Unavailable Races:** Cat-folk, half-orcs, half-ogres, gnomes.
- **Native Languages (per race):**
    - **Human:** Choose from Archontean, Thorcin, Wiskin, or Khumus. Default is Archontean if none chosen.
    - **Elf:** Elvish.
    - **Half-Elf:** Choose from Archontean, Thorcin, Wiskin, Khumus, or Elvish. Can take a second native language if raised in both cultures.
    - **Dwarf:** Dwarvish.
    - **Halfling**: Archontean.
    - **Imperial Goblin**: Archontean.

- **Important Languages in the Area:**
    - **Archontean**: More urban and ruling class.
    - **Thorcin**: More rural and working class.
    - **Mithric**: The language of the ancient Archontean Empire, currently a "dead" native language but essential for magic, some religions, and scholars. Spellbooks and scrolls are written in Mithric, so mages and clerics should know it.
- **Language Levels:** Allowed to take languages at Accented or Broken levels for fewer points (using GURPS Basic Set rules in GCS).

## Equipment and Economy

- **Starting Equipment:** Per DFRPG rules. Can buy Wealth or trade points for cash at the start.
- **Available Equipment:** Any non-magical equipment from DFRPG: Adventurers (excluding plate armor, which does not exist in the setting). GM approval needed for common non-magical items not listed.
- **Post-Start Equipment:** Special orders and magical equipment may not be reliably available, possibly requiring availability rolls, travel to major cities, or hiring an enchanter.
- **Coinage:** Uses AD&D coin value ratios with a silver piece standard.
    - **Copper:** $0.1
    - **Silver:** $1
    - **Electrum:** $5 (rarely used)
    - **Gold:** $10
    - **Platinum:** $50
    - PCs can largely use GURPS dollars and ignore exact coins unless weight is a factor. Coins are available in GCS under Home Brew / Arden Vul Equipment.

## Perks

- **Burdock's Valley Local [1]:** A new perk. If taken, the PC has lived in the Burdock's Valley area long enough to gain extra rumors, an area map, and default Area Knowledge. PCs without this perk arrive as outsiders and must ask NPCs for directions.

# Arden Vul: The Archontean Calendar (2025-03-08)

This document describes the structure and unique characteristics of the Archontean Calendar, as it functions within the Magae world setting of Arden Vul.

## Calendar Structure

-   **Months:** 12 months, each with exactly 30 days.
-   **Year Length:** The year on Magae is 372 days (compared to Earth's 365/365.25 days).
-   **Intercalary Periods:** To account for the 372-day year, two 6-day intercalary periods are added:
    -   **Mercedonian Days (Days of Wages):** Occurs right after the New Year.
    -   **Voluptarian Days (Days of Pleasure):** Occurs two-thirds of the way through the year, between the eighth and ninth month, coinciding with the harvest festival. This asymmetrical placement makes "faux-historical sense" given typical harvest times.

## Days of the Week

The week consists of seven days, each named after a deity or celestial body:

-   **Basilsday:** Named for the Emperor.
-   **Lunday:** Named for the Moon.
-   **Tothsday:** Named for Thoth (a Greater God of the old pantheon, no longer popular).
-   **Mitrasday:** Named for Mitra (a god of the new pantheon).
-   **Tahsday:** Named for Ptah (a god of the old pantheon).
-   **Horasday:** Named for Horus (a god of the old pantheon, unpopular and possibly dead).
-   **Demmasday:** Named for Demma (a goddess of the new pantheon).

## Translation and GM Notes

-   The different year lengths and intercalary periods complicate direct translation between real-world and game-world calendars.
-   The GM typically "wings it" by syncing game seasons with real seasons and using real-world weather analogs.
-   Dates are primarily used for seasonal weather and tracking weekly game progression (as PCs usually delve once a week).
-   The "silly jumble of historical accidents" in the calendar, particularly the inconsistent naming of days, is noted as a realistic touch for a fictional world.

# Ioannes' Journal - The Tower Ghost

## Demmasday, 25th of Lucrios, 2993 AEP

### The Tower Ghost

I found the record. The tower at the base of the tower was left behind when the survivors fled.
And now it is haunted. Or rather, “folklore,” according to one too-convenient source.

I do not trust him. He either never saw the ghost himself, or pretended not to.

I did. The spirit that emerged from that cellar did not wander aimlessly or mutter incoherently. It screamed—accused. “Settite murderers,” it said. That is not a random haunt. That is a wronged soul. It is bound, and it is angry.

This is not folklore. This is unfinished business.

Demma teaches that proper rest follows proper ritual. Perhaps there is something to uncover: a hidden corpse, a desecrated relic, an oath unfulfilled. I will return. Not yet. But soon. And I will put it to rest.

Gods grant that it is no demon. If it is, I will not face it alone.

# Rudishva Artifact Research

Rudishva devices.
- Some of these pictures match items found by the party, allowing for their identification in the loot sheet.
- Experimenting with the devices might be safer if the warnings in the book are consulted first.
- The writing is confusing, and some devices look similar, leading to uncertainty in identification.

# Rudishva Funeral Rites

Vallium Halcyon and the party inquired with Akla-Chah about Rudishva burial/funeral rites, prompted by a glyph found on a stone seat and the presence of a corpse.

## Funeral Traditions

Akla-Chah explained that the Rudishva have a few different funeral traditions, ranked by preference:

1.  **Full Recycling:**
    -   Considered the best method.
    -   The Beacon currently lacks the ability to perform this.
2.  **Spacing:**
    -   The second-best method.
    -   The Beacon currently lacks the ability to perform this either.
3.  **Cremation:**
    -   The third-best method.
    -   Might be practical if the party has the means to build a suitably hot fire, somewhere outside the Beacon.

# Sortians Research

Empire back a thousand years.

Among their "sins" were:
- Summoning Empire survived, albeit with smaller borders.
- Spell use was eventually opened up.
- Some old churches lost power, and new ones took their place.
- Priscus Pulcher and the Sortians are still remembered as traitors, though many are unclear on the specifics.

## The Philosopher Statue

- The "Philosopher" is a generic figure.
- Priscus Pulcher was an actual historical figure.
- He did look similar to "The Philosopher" later in his life, but it's unclear which came first.
