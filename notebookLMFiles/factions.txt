# Adrienic Expedition

## Summary

A military expedition led by Archon Phocion IV approximately 250 years ago.

## History

The expedition was an attempt to retake Arden Vul. It was composed of six cohorts of legionaries: five from the "Sheepshead Rangers" and one from the emperor's own guards tagmata.

The expedition failed bloodily and all six cohorts were lost in a battle fought at the Cavern of Blood, where their battle standards were also lost. The Haunted Tower at the base of the Waterfall was built during this expedition and abandoned when the survivors fled.

A rumor claims that the leader of the expedition, a certain "Adrienic" (presumably Archon Phocion IV), committed suicide rather than report his failure.

## History
- Session 8a - Never Trust a Scorpion: Roskelly Winterleaf during an engagement in the Session 1 - First Visit to the Ruins of Arden Vul — The four hired Ashe, a druid from the Grudge Brigade, to come along on this mission, for an equal share of treasure.
- Session 2 - Halfling Rent-Seekers — They also walked over to the Grudge Brigade Mercenary Company's "Headquarters" (a small building on the outskirts of Gosterwick).
- Session 4 - Cheese and Crackers and Thoth and Demons — Uvash was still tied up in intense theological debate at the House of Gods, so the group decided to hire the mercenary on call at the Grudge Brigade, a female elven archer named Merenuithiel.
- Session 5 - Parleys and The Great Cavern — Uvash returned from the House of the Gods to join the others on the trip, but Michael was once again out in the wilderness somewhere, so the group recruited the on-call mercenary at the Grudge Brigade, a ti...
- Session 6 - Good Ghost, Bad Ghost — They hired Ashe, the goat-summoning druid, from the Grudge Brigade.
- Session 7 - Why Did It Have to Be Plants? — Short a mage, the group hired the Grudge Brigade leader Coinbase again, since he was available and definitely good at selling treasure, as well as allegedly being able to cast some spells.

- Session 20 - The Outer Caverns of Set — Michael was off in the woods somewhere, so the Right for Riches company hired the Grudge Brigade mercenary on call, the goblin druid GOAT.
- Session 23c - Set Jailbreak and Down to Goblintown — A few days after the Right for Riches Company returned to Gosterwick, two things happened: Coinbase, leader of the Grudge Brigade Mercenary Company, received an anonymous offer under his door.

  - Session 26 - The Scouring of the Shire — Uvash was unexpectedly ill (some suspected a hangover after the harvest festivals, but that was also unusual for a dwarf), so they hired Lacrymosa the mercenary archer from the Grudge Brigade.
- Session 29 - The Tower of Scrutiny — What Actually Happened: The Right for Riches company, without Vael or Michael but with Coinbase the head Grudge Brigade Mercenary, left Gosterwick just before dawn on Horasday.
- Session 31 - I Want to Believe — When they got there Uvash was still busy trying to convert Torunn the Smith to Zodarrim, but they'd just lost most of a week walking to Newmarket and back, so they went to the Grudge Brigade and hired Ashe ...

# Sortians

## Summary
The Sortians were a historical faction, now remembered as traitors, who instigated a civil war in 1698 AEP by rebelling against the established magical order.

## Beliefs and Practices
Led by Priscus Pulcher, the Sortians believed that anyone with magical aptitude should be allowed to cast spells, challenging the control held by approved churches and colleges.

They were considered heretical for many reasons, including:
- Summoning demons.
- Allowing women and elves to hold leadership positions.
- Creating "graven images" in the form of magical statues of their leader for worship. Rituals involving these statues sometimes used magical eyes to achieve effects like passing messages or teleportation.

## History
The Sortians' rebellion against the established order led to a long and costly Civil War. The conflict is blamed for the abandonment of the Exarchate of Narsileon and setting the Empire back a thousand years.

Though the Empire survived with smaller borders and spell use was eventually opened up, the Sortians and their leader Priscus Pulcher (who was executed by an Exarch) are still considered traitors.

## Notes
- Information about them is found in the Book of Priors and in old books in the Library of Mitra.
- Their leader, Priscus Pulcher, is said to have resembled the statues known as "The Philosopher".
