# Arden

## Summary

Arden is one of the 20 Worthies of the Empire and a legendary hero who lived approximately 2100 years ago. Along with her partner, [[npcs/Vul the Sorcerer.md|Vul the Sorcerer]], she discovered the cavern system that would become the [[Halls of Arden Vul]]. The city founded there was later named in their honor.

## History & Lore

According to historical records, Arden completed eleven of the "Twelve Labors," which involved defeating a host of formidable foes like owlbears, trolls, undead, dragons, and Wiskin berserkers. The twelfth labor is said to be "still to be done at the time of the Empire's Need."

At the peak of their power, both Arden and Vul mysteriously disappeared, and their bodies were never recovered. Some popular tales claim that Arden did not die but ascended to a state of demi-godhood, though official histories dispute this.

### Cult of Arden
A [[factions/Cult of Arden.md|Cult of Arden]] was known to exist among the military officials in Arden Vul. This cult reportedly built their own headquarters within the Halls and attempted to replicate the famous Labors of Arden.

### The Twelve Labours of Arden
A book titled `[[items/The Twelve Labours of Arden.md|The Twelve Labours of Arden]]` is believed to be a guide for a puzzle that begins with a purification ritual at the fountain beneath the [[locations/Waterfall.md|waterfall]].

# Barnaby Goodbarrel

## Summary
Barnaby Goodbarrel is a halfling lawyer practicing in [[Gosterwick]]. He is regarded by some, such as [[Wicktrimmer]], as the "second best lawyer in town." He provides legal services for company formation and contract law.

## Services & Fees
- **Initial Consultation:** $100
- **Company Charter (Gosterwick):** $500. This requires approval from [[Eusebia Phokas]], the [[Thesmothete of Vetucaster]], and can take several weeks. He accepted a $750 fee to "rush" the process.

# Ethereum “Coinbase” Thuringwador

## Summary
Ethereum “Coinbase” Thuringwador is an elven illusionist and the leader of the [[factions/Grudge Brigade|Grudge Brigade]] mercenary company. Often described by the party as an "annoying elf," Coinbase is a relentless hustler and fixer, constantly trying to upsell clients on his "illusion-based tactical assistance system" or brokering deals. Despite his sometimes-abrasive salesmanship, he is a competent illusionist and a pragmatic, if self-serving, ally who has joined the [[factions/Right for Riches Company|Right for Riches Company]] on several delves.

## History & Interactions
Coinbase has been a recurring hired spellcaster for the [[factions/Right for Riches Company|Right for Riches Company]], stepping in when the party's own mages are unavailable. His services, however, always come with a sales pitch.

His most significant non-combat interaction involved the [[factions/Cult of Set|Cult of Set]]. He received an anonymous contract offering a substantial reward for the death of the party members and [[npcs/Susarra|Susarra]]. Rather than acting on it, Coinbase saw a better business opportunity and sold the information to [[pcs/Vael Sunshadow|Vael]], providing the party with crucial intelligence about the threat against them ([[sessions/Session 23c - Set Jailbreak and Down to Goblintown]]).

During the harrowing delve into the [[locations/Tower of Scrutiny|Tower of Scrutiny]], it was Coinbase who wisely called for a tactical retreat when the party was overwhelmed by wraiths, a decision that likely saved them from a total party kill ([[sessions/Session 29 - The Tower of Scrutiny]]). He has also proven adept at creative problem-solving, such as using his "probably unbreakable" orichalcum shield as a crowbar to break open a tomb plug ([[sessions/Session 3 - Dragons and Baboons and Beastmen, Oh My!]]).

## Roles & Influence
- **Leader of the [[factions/Grudge Brigade|Grudge Brigade]]:** As the head of the mercenary company, he manages contracts and deploys his subordinates.
- **Mercenary Illusionist:** Provides magical support for hire, specializing in illusion and utility spells like [[spells/Levitation|Levitation]] and [[spells/Phantom|Phantom]].
- **Information Broker:** His position as a mercenary leader gives him access to the undercurrents of Gosterwick's adventurer economy, making him a valuable, if costly, source of information.

## Abilities
Coinbase has demonstrated a range of magical and combat abilities:
- **Illusion Magic:** He frequently uses a **[[spells/Phantom|Phantom]]** spell to create semi-real illusions that can assist in combat.
- **Utility Spells:** He is a frequent user of **[[spells/Levitation|Levitation]]** for transport and has also used **Lighten Burden**.
- **Combat:** While primarily a mage, he is not shy about entering melee, using his expensive **orichalcum shield** for both defense and offense (shield-bashing). He has been noted as being a particularly fast runner.
- **Negotiation:** He is a shrewd negotiator, always looking to maximize his profit, as seen in his dealings with the halfling toll collectors.

## Relationships
- **[[factions/Right for Riches Company|Right for Riches Company]]:** His primary clients. The relationship is purely business, though his timely advice has proven life-saving.
- **[[factions/Cult of Set|Cult of Set]]:** He was contracted by them to assassinate the party, but he betrayed the contract for a better offer from the party themselves.
- **[[npcs/Ashe Maykum|Ashe "GOAT" Maykum]]:** He has promoted and attempted to sell the GOAT's inventions, such as the [[items/Living Wheelbarrow|Living Wheelbarrow]].

# Craastonistorex

## Summary

Craastonistorex is a huge green dragon who lairs in the ruins of [[Arden Vul]] and considers himself the apex predator of the area. He has at least one pet wyvern named [[Briar]].

He has made a deal with the party to act as "Wardens of the Dam" in exchange for tribute.

## Disposition

Hostile and extremely dangerous, but willing to negotiate if it serves his interests.

## Notes

- An account from approximately 50 years ago details an encounter between the dragon and a party of 12 of [[Lord Burdock]]'s men-at-arms, where he killed 10 of them. This event led Lord Burdock to forbid exploration of the ruins.
- **Rumor:** The dragon rules the surface ruins and extorts a toll on those he catches exiting the Halls.
- **Rumor:** He is rumored to be the son of a more ancient wyrm that lives at the bottom of the [[Great Chasm]].

## Relationships
- [[Briar]]: pet wyvern serving as a scout and enforcer.
- PCs (“Wardens of the Dam”): negotiated arrangement trading tribute for limited non‑interference.

# Demma

Demma, the "Great Nurturer," is a goddess of fertility, crops, households, childbirth, and magic. She is part of the new pantheon of gods, and the fifth day of the week, [[The Archontean Calendar#Demmasday|Demmasday]], is named in her honor.

## Mythology
Ancient myths portray Demma as the one who sowed the first seeds of life and ensures the continuation of the cycles of growth, harvest, and renewal. It is said that she stole the secret of magic from the void and planted it within the soil and stars, granting mortals the ability to shape the world through wisdom and will.

Though her blessings are gentle, her wrath is unyielding. When her gifts are hoarded, abused, or defiled, she strikes with famine, blight, and barrenness. Her sacred weapon is the flail, symbolizing both the harvest and divine retribution. To understand her will is to understand the balance of nature, hearth, and spirit.

## Theology & Worship
The theology of Demma centers on balance, stewardship, and the sacred duty of cultivation—whether of land, family, or knowledge. Abundance is a gift given only to those who nurture it with wisdom and hard work. To act recklessly is to invite ruin, for Demma can withdraw her gifts as easily as she grants them.

Her followers are called to protect the cycles of nature, strengthen households, and guide new life. Magic is viewed as a seed of creation, a natural force to be cultivated responsibly. True wisdom is believed to come from action, not just study. Worshipers often bring offerings of seeds, bread, and woven charms to honor her blessings.

## The Priesthood of Demma
The priesthood is hierarchical yet practical, structured to emphasize stewardship and active service.

### Clergy and Vestments
The standard attire for Demma's clergy consists of a long tunic in earthy tones (deep greens, golden yellows, or rich browns) with seed-like embroidery. Over this, they wear a sleeveless outer robe in deep red or russet. A broad, gold-threaded sash is worn at the waist, often adorned with woven charms, seed pouches, or small flail-shaped talismans. For ceremonial occasions, priests may don a hooded cloak fastened with a brooch shaped like a seed.

The vestments are designed to be practical for work, reinforcing the belief that faith is meant to be lived, not just displayed.

### Branches of the Faith
- **[[factions/Seedkeepers|Seedkeepers]]:** A scholarly, more esoteric branch of the priesthood. They guard ancient agricultural knowledge, sacred fertility rites, and study the interplay between magic and the natural world.
- **[[factions/Harvest Guardians|Harvest Guardians]]:** The dedicated warrior arm of the faith. They defend temples and enforce Demma's will, wielding the flail. Each major temple typically has a contingent of six to twelve fighters.

## Notable Followers
- **[[pcs/Ioannes Grammatikos Byzantios|Ioannes Grammatikos Byzantios]]:** A player character and a scholarly, Archontean cleric of Demma. His personal attire is slightly more ornate than that of the rural clergy, reflecting his broader understanding of Demma's role in magic and wisdom.
- **[[npcs/Vivian|Vivian]]:** The stern but fair Thorcin chief priest of the [[locations/Temple of Demma|Temple of Demma]] in [[locations/Gosterwick|Gosterwick]]. He is capable of casting powerful spells, such as Remove Curse.

## Associated Locations
- **[[locations/Temple of Demma|Temple of Demma]]:** The temple in [[locations/Gosterwick|Gosterwick]] is a modest but well-maintained structure that serves as a center for healing and rural devotion. It is a frequent destination for the [[factions/Right for Riches Company|Right for Riches Company]] to receive healing and find refuge for those they rescue.
- **Demmasday Market:** The central market in [[locations/Gosterwick|Gosterwick]] is held on Totsday and all of Demmasday, with the latter being the biggest market of the week.

## History & Key Events
Demma's influence is felt frequently in the party's adventures, primarily through her cleric, [[pcs/Ioannes Grammatikos Byzantios|Ioannes]]. The [[locations/Temple of Demma|Temple in Gosterwick]] has proven to be a crucial resource, providing vital services like curse removal on multiple occasions.

An early incident at the [[locations/Yellow Cloak Inn|Yellow Cloak Inn]], where an accidental Continual Darkness spell was cast on some bedsheets, resulted in clerics of Demma being forbidden from casting spells on the premises. The party also regularly visits the Demmasday market in town to procure supplies.

  - [[sessions/Session 1 - First Visit to the Ruins of Arden Vul.md|Session 1 - First Visit to the Ruins of Arden Vul]] — In addition to the ibis head statue and the corpses, the top floor also featured a couple of wooden stairways down, but only the first few feet of each stairway was visible before things got dark with a suspiciously sharp cutoff.
- [[sessions/Session 2 - Halfling Rent-Seekers.md|Session 2 - Halfling Rent-Seekers]] — There stood a 20' tall statue of Thoth in Ibis-headed form, with a body of purple porphyry stone and a head of white marble, with eyes of green jade.
  - [[sessions/Session 2 - Halfling Rent-Seekers.md|Session 2 - Halfling Rent-Seekers]] — The walls were lined with sixteen pictures of ibis heads all looking at the same point in the center of the floor, but there was nothing interesting at that point.
- [[sessions/Session 3 - Dragons and Baboons and Beastmen, Oh My!.md|Session 3 - Dragons and Baboons and Beastmen, Oh My!]] — Ioannes went down the stairs alone a bit, and saw that these stairs were much less worn than the other ones, that there were pictures of various animals (hippo, crocodile, ibis, baboon, giraffe) on the front of the stairs, and that there...

# Merenuithiel Armaris

## Summary
Merenuithiel "Lacrymosa" Armaris is a skilled but notoriously aggressive Elven mercenary archer, frequently hired by the [[factions/Right for Riches Company|Right for Riches Company]] from the [[factions/Grudge Brigade|Grudge Brigade]]. She serves as recurring ranged support and is known for her deadly efficiency in combat and a relentless desire to confront and kill halflings.

## Personality and Reputation
Lacrymosa has earned a reputation for being "bloodthirsty." She is single-minded in her goals, tirelessly advocating for aggressive solutions and showing no hesitation in combat. This was most evident in her brutal efficiency during the assault on [[npcs/Phlebotomas Plumthorn|Plumthorn's]] gang, where she killed stunned, fleeing, or surrendering enemies without pause.

Despite her aggression, she can be a team player, participating in planning and negotiations. She has also shown a moment of humility, apologizing after her recklessness led to her being incapacitated during a fight with stirges.

Her defining character trait is a deep-seated animosity towards the extortionist halflings of [[npcs/Phlebotomas Plumthorn|Phlebotomas Plumthorn]], a topic she raises almost every time she is hired.

Her nickname "Lacrymosa" is derived from her elven grace and deadly accuracy with a bow, evoking a sense of solemn beauty.

## First Appearance
[[sessions/Session 4 - Cheese and Crackers and Thoth and Demons.md|Session 4 - Cheese and Crackers and Thoth and Demons]]

## Notable Actions
Lacrymosa has been involved in numerous operations with the party, often turning the tide of difficult fights.

- **First Hiring (Session 4):** First hired from the [[factions/Grudge Brigade|Grudge Brigade]], she aided the party in exploring a section of the [[locations/Pyramid of Thoth|Pyramid of Thoth]], fighting off demons and flying jellyfish-like creatures. She was already advocating for fighting the halflings.
- **Negotiations at the Inn (Session 8b & 9):** She assisted the party in negotiating the sale of three gold shabti statues to merchant factors at the [[locations/Sign of the Broken Head|Sign of the Broken Head]].
- **The Great Cavern (Session 15):** During a return to the [[locations/Great Cavern|Great Cavern]], she accidentally shot [[pcs/Vallium|Vallium]] in the back. Later, she was swarmed by stirges and knocked unconscious after acting alone, for which she apologized. She also served as a makeshift boat captain for the party.
- **Well of Light (Session 22):** Hired again, she immediately asked if it was "time to kill the halflings yet." She helped clear a room of ghouls and fought animated ibis statues, but did not take part in the spiritual "Litany of Light" ritual.
- **The Halfling Takedown (Session 26):** Lacrymosa was instrumental in the successful ambush of [[npcs/Phlebotomas Plumthorn|Plumthorn's]] halfling gang. Using potions and a Concussion spell, she neutralized and killed numerous halflings, including the leader [[npcs/Blandveg|Blandveg]] and a fleeing [[npcs/Roskelly Winterleaf|Roskelly Winterleaf]]. Her brutal efficiency was a key factor in the encounter.
- **Official Recognition (Session 32):** For her role in the "Great Reconquest of [[locations/Upper Goblintown|Upper Goblintown]]," she was officially recognized by [[npcs/Weskenim|King Weskenim]] and awarded a patch naming her a "**Halfling Slayer**."

# Phlebotomas Plumthorn

## Summary
Phlebotomas Plumthorn was the halfling mob boss who ran an extortion racket near the pyramid landings under [[locations/Arden Vul|Arden Vul]]. For a long time, he and his gang of thugs controlled access to the [[locations/Halls of Thoth|Halls of Thoth]], demanding payment from all who passed. His operation was ultimately dismantled by the [[factions/Right for Riches Company|Right for Riches Company]] in a decisive assault.

## Criminal Enterprise
Plumthorn's gang controlled the territory beneath the [[locations/Pyramid of Thoth|Pyramid of Thoth]]. His business model involved:
- **"Adventuring Licenses":** Forcing adventurers to purchase a license for 25 gp to enter the area.
- **Tithing:** Demanding a 10% tithe on all treasure recovered by licensed parties.
- **Protection Racket:** Extending his influence beyond the ruins, running a protection racket for merchants as far away as [[locations/Newmarket|Newmarket]].
- **Armed Enforcement:** His gang was known to be well-armed, reportedly using magic wands and poison.

## Relationships
- **[[npcs/Roskelly Winterleaf|Roskelly Winterleaf]]:** Plumthorn's primary lieutenant, responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of the toll collection. He was killed by [[npcs/Lacrymosa|Lacrymosa]] while attempting to flee during the party's final assault.
- **[[npcs/Blandveg|Blandveg]]:** An Archontean mage, alchemist, and poisoner who worked with the halflings. He was also killed by [[npcs/Lacrymosa|Lacrymosa]].
- **[[npcs/Weskenim|King Weskenim]]:** A significant rival. Plumthorn's gang was squatting on territory that Weskenim considered a rightful goblin entrance to the surface. The goblin king encouraged the party to act as "halfling exterminators."
- **[[factions/Right for Riches Company|Right for Riches Company]]:** Plumthorn's relationship with the party was fraught with tension from their first meeting. The constant tolls and harassment were a recurring point of frustration, eventually leading to his downfall.

## The Downfall
After numerous sessions of debate and planning, the [[factions/Right for Riches Company|Right for Riches Company]] finally moved against Plumthorn in **Session 26**.
- **The Plan:** Aided by the mercenary [[npcs/Lacrymosa|Lacrymosa]], the party used a combination of flight and invisibility spells to bypass Plumthorn's guards and strike directly at the leadership.
- **The Assault:** The ambush was a resounding success. Lacrymosa killed [[npcs/Blandveg|Blandveg]] almost immediately. Plumthorn was quickly wounded and, after a successful intimidation by [[pcs/Vael Sunshadow|Vael]], was forced to surrender.
- **The Aftermath:** Plumthorn was stripped of his possessions, including his keys, which were later copied and given to the goblins. He and his surviving followers were exiled from [[locations/Arden Vul|Arden Vul]] and instructed to return to [[locations/Newmarket|Newmarket]] under threat of death. His former territory was then ceded to [[npcs/Weskenim|King Weskenim]]'s goblins.

# Ptarmis

## Summary
Mysterious Thoth‑aligned wizard tied to the fungal caverns near the [[Great Cavern]]. Accounts conflict between a living recluse met by the party and a historical Thothian priest of the same name credited with opening the cavern and cultivating giant mushrooms.

## Appears In
- [[sessions/Session 5 - Parleys and The Great Cavern.md|Session 5 - Parleys and The Great Cavern]]
- [[sessions/Session 6 - Good Ghost, Bad Ghost.md|Session 6 - Good Ghost, Bad Ghost]]
- [[sessions/Session 30 - The Tomb of Theskalon.md|Session 30 - The Tomb of Theskalon]]

## Roles & Influence
- Claimed “master of the cavern”; rumored to direct or bargain with the [[Fungal Foresters]].
- Historical priest of [[Thoth]] associated with discovery and control of the [[Great Cavern]].

## Relationships
- [[Fungal Foresters]]: alleged influence or control; at minimum long familiarity.
- Thothian orders: strong association in inscriptions and lore; ambiguous across eras.

## History
- [[sessions/Session 5 - Parleys and The Great Cavern.md|Session 5 - Parleys and The Great Cavern]] — # DFRPG Arden Vul Session 5: Parleys and [[locations/Great Cavern.md|The Great Cavern]] Date: Demmasday, 11th of Lucrios, 2993 AEP Weather: Cool, overcast, rainy Player Char...
  - [[sessions/Session 5 - Parleys and The Great Cavern.md|Session 5 - Parleys and The Great Cavern]] — The man identified himself as Ptarmis, the master of the cavern.
- [[sessions/Session 6 - Good Ghost, Bad Ghost.md|Session 6 - Good Ghost, Bad Ghost]] — Vallium again tried finding rumors about Plumthorn's halfling gang in various drinking establishments, and instead heard something about Ptarmis, a wizard who lived in the fungal caverns.
- [[sessions/Session 25 - Looking for the Back Door to the Forum of Set.md|Session 25 - Looking for the Back Door to the Forum of Set]] — The lead forester talked about how cool Ptarmis was and how much he liked the living wheelbarrow and asked if they were friends of Ptarmis.
  - [[sessions/Session 25 - Looking for the Back Door to the Forum of Set.md|Session 25 - Looking for the Back Door to the Forum of Set]] — Vael indicated that they were also friends of Ptarmis and asked if the foresters had a source of cloud cap mushrooms.
- [[sessions/Session 30 - The Tomb of Theskalon.md|Session 30 - The Tomb of Theskalon]] — There was a Mithric inscription on the sarcophagus: Here rests Ptarmis loyal servant of Thoth seeker of hidden ways who destroyed the loathsome ones raised his children from spores and opened this cavern Those who disturb his sleep Will ...
  - [[sessions/Session 30 - The Tomb of Theskalon.md|Session 30 - The Tomb of Theskalon]] — This was a bit confusing, since they'd met a man named Ptarmis, on the throne a bit to the east, who was very much alive.

## Notes

- A found note claims that Ptarmis can control the [[Fungal Foresters]].
- Historical research identifies a figure named Ptarmis as a famous [[Thoth|Thothian]] priest from the early days of [[Arden Vul]].
- This historical Ptarmis is credited with discovering the [[Great Cavern]] and bringing it under Archontean control.
- He was also known for breeding giant mushrooms, and one source claims he left his family and church to live with them like a "weird Druid."
- This historical context is confusing, as the party has met a man named Ptarmis who is currently alive.
- A sarcophagus has been found with an inscription for a "Ptarmis loyal servant of Thoth."
- **Rumor:** A rumor states that the great Thothian wizard Ptarmis built a secret tomb for himself amid a huge forest of colossal mushrooms on the second level from the surface. The explorers who found the cavern were driven back by [[Sheep-headed Critters]].

## Hook
A name shared across centuries: hermit wizard or the echo of a Thothian master?

## Notes

## Death & Investigation
Susarra was murdered in her room at the [[Yellow Cloak Inn]] in [[Gosterwick]]. Her headless corpse was discovered by [[Vallium Halcyon]] after he was discretely summoned by the innkeeper, [[Margot the Red]]. The initial investigation was handled by the [[Thesmothete]]'s guards, who noted that it took the killer several blows with a large, sharp axe to sever her head. Her head, axe, ring, mail, and backpack were all taken from the scene.

The murder is believed to be retaliation from the [[Cult of Set]], as Susarra had recently participated in a violent raid against them in the ruins of [[Arden Vul]]. This was confirmed when [[Coinbase]], a member of the [[Grudge Brigade]], sold the party a letter he had received. The letter offered a bounty of $2,500 each for the capture or kill of [[Vael]], [[Ioannes]], [[Michael]], [[Uvash]], [[Vallium Halcyon]], and Susarra. The instructions were to bring the remains to the [[Duty Deacon]] at the [[Forum of Set|Forum in Arden Vul]], who would then alert the [[Pontifex]].

The [[Drome]] was officially informed of the murder, and [[Audun Yellow-Eyes]], a logothete of the House of Sight, provided the party with a sample of Susarra's blood for magical tracking. Using a *Seeker* spell, [[Vael]] was able to determine that Susarra's head was approximately 10 miles north of [[Gosterwick]], in a well-decorated room, stored inside a backpack.

## Relationships
- **PCs**: Fought alongside the party during their push into the lower caverns and the assault on the [[Cult of Set]].
- **[[Cult of Set]]**: Adversaries. They placed a bounty on her head and are the primary suspects in her assassination.
- **[[Margot the Red]]**: The innkeeper who discovered her body and alerted the party.
- **[[Audun Yellow-Eyes]]**: A logothete of the [[Drome]] who assisted the party in their investigation.
- **[[Coinbase]]**: A member of the [[Grudge Brigade]] who provided crucial intelligence regarding the bounty.

# Thoth

## Summary
Deity associated with knowledge, libraries, and inscriptions throughout [[Arden Vul]]; many structures bear his name (e.g., [[locations/Pyramid of Thoth.md|Pyramid of Thoth]], [[locations/Library of Thoth.md|Library of Thoth]], [[locations/Glory of Thoth.md|Glory of Thoth]]). Mentions in sessions often describe statues, rituals, or sites dedicated to Thoth rather than direct manifestations.

## Notes

- A rumor suggests that while [[Thoth represented the light of knowledge that erased the darkness of ignorance, he was also the guardian of secrets, revealing his most potent wisdom only to the devout.
- Another rumor claims that the numerous statues of Thoth have eyes made of huge gemstones. Removing these gems is said to allow the bearer to contact Thoth directly, but doing so causes the statues to animate and attack. This is corroborated by a piece of graffiti found in the [[Pyramid of Thoth.

# King Weskenim

## Summary
Weskenim is the ambitious and pragmatic ruler of the [[factions/United Goblins|United Goblins]], styling himself as their Grand King. From his court in [[locations/Goblintown|Goblintown]], he presides over a growing territory that includes the [[locations/Wet Caves|Wet Caves]] and the repurposed "Glory of Weskenim" (formerly the [[locations/Glory of Thoth|Glory of Thoth]]). While he projects authority through a network of sub-chiefs and sergeants, his rule is not universally accepted among all goblins, with some outlying groups openly disparaging him. He is known for his distinctive pink turban and his fondness for his pet cat, which can sometimes distract him from matters of state.

## History & Interactions
King Weskenim's relationship with the [[factions/Right for Riches Company|Right for Riches Company]] began in earnest after they rescued his brother, [[npcs/Gribble|Gribble]], from the clutches of the [[factions/Cult of Set|Cult of Set]] ([[sessions/Session 23c - Set Jailbreak and Down to Goblintown]]).

A major point of contention for Weskenim was the occupation of what he considered goblin territory by [[npcs/Phlebotomas Plumthorn|Phlebotomas Plumthorn]]'s halfling gang. He enlisted the Right for Riches Company as "halfling exterminators" to deal with this problem. Upon the party's success in ousting Plumthorn ([[sessions/Session 26 - The Scouring of the Shire]]), a grateful Weskenim rewarded them with a large perfect diamond, a suit of human-sized magical scale armor from an ancient goblin king, and free passage through goblin lands. Several party members were also awarded "Halfling Slayer" patches, created by the goblin artist [[npcs/Temrin|Temrin]].

Weskenim is keenly interested in recovering the legendary **Scepter of the Goblins**, which he believes is key to unifying all goblin clans under his rule. He has promised the adventurers a further reward for its retrieval, though he dismisses the goblin mystic [[npcs/Gislu|Gislu]], who also seeks it, as a "fake."

He maintains a court with a major-domo named [[npcs/Palestrim|Palestrim]] and advisors like [[npcs/Skimmel|Skimmel]] and [[npcs/Reeflik|Reeflik]]. He has shown a degree of political cunning, deliberately delaying an audience with a group of mysterious wizards he suspected were hostile to the [[factions/Varumani|Varumani]], whom he wishes to avoid conflict with.

## Roles & Influence
- **Goblin Unifier:** Aspires to unite all goblin clans under his banner.
- **Territorial Expansion:** Actively works to expand goblin-controlled areas within [[locations/Arden Vul|Arden Vul]].
- **Key Quest Giver:** Has tasked the [[factions/Right for Riches Company|Right for Riches Company]] with recovering the [[items/Scepter of the Goblins|Scepter of the Goblins]].
 - **Faction Leader:** Commands a significant military force, including ogre guards and numerous goblin warriors led by officers like [[npcs/Killick.md|Killik]] and [[npcs/Bottleneck.md|Bottleneck]].

## Relationships
- **[[npcs/Gribble|Gribble]]:** His brother. Gribble's rescue from a [[factions/Cult of Set|Set]] prison was the catalyst for Weskenim's alliance with the party.
- **[[npcs/Phlebotomas Plumthorn|Phlebotomas Plumthorn]]:** A major rival whose expulsion from the Halls was a key victory for Weskenim, secured with the party's help.
- **[[factions/Right for Riches Company|Right for Riches Company]]:** A key, if sometimes transactional, ally. He has rewarded them for their services and relies on them for important tasks.
- **[[npcs/Palestrim|Palestrim]]:** His major-domo, responsible for managing the royal court.
- **[[npcs/Bottleneck|Bottleneck]]:** His Master Sergeant in [[locations/Upper Goblintown|Upper Goblintown]].
- **[[npcs/Killick.md|Killik]]:** The "Big Boss" of the [[locations/Wet Caves.md|Wet Caves]], who reports directly to Weskenim.
- **[[npcs/Sir Sorrow|Sir Sorrow]]:** A [[factions/Sun-Scarred Knights|Sun-Scarred Knight]] who was a guest in his court for a time.
- **[[npcs/Gislu|Gislu]]:** A rival for power who claims to be a mystic; Weskenim considers him a fraud.

## Notes
- Some goblins, particularly a splinter group living with baboons, hold a negative view of his rule, stating "King Weskenim sucked."
- He has a harem, from which he was emerging when the party arrived to report on their victory over the halflings.
- The goblin artist [[Temrin]] has painted portraits of both Weskenim and [[Gribble]].

# Wicktrimmer

## Summary
Wicktrimmer is a wealthy and influential goblin who runs the [[Rarities Factor]] in [[Gosterwick]]. He is a retired adventurer, a savvy businessman, and an avid collector of magical and historical artifacts. He is considered one of the most powerful people in Gosterwick.

## Background
Wicktrimmer was formerly a member of an adventuring party called [[Lost and Found]], which was led by the wizard [[Balthazar the Blue]] and the paladin [[Grimley]]. His party explored [[Arden Vul]] extensively, making it as far as the [[Obsidian Gates]] before the party disbanded when Balthazar retired.

Twelve years ago, Wicktrimmer founded the [[Rarities Factor]] in [[Gosterwick]], later expanding to [[Newmarket]] and [[Narsileon]].

## Business & Capabilities
As the head of the [[Rarities Factor]], Wicktrimmer offers banking, letters of credit, and shipping via mule caravan at cheaper rates than his competitors. He also has a number of other capabilities:
- **Intelligence:** He seems to know everything that happens in Gosterwick and has magical means of detecting any new magic items that enter the town.
- **Resources:** He employs his own wizard, [[Ingimund of Arcturus]], for identifying magical items.
- **Logistics:** He can arrange for concierge shopping in [[Narsileon]] and can send messages there in less than a day.
- **Connections:** He is apparently friends with other important local figures, such as the [[Green Lady]] and [[Lady Alexia Basileon]].

## Notable Interactions
- **The Larel Artifacts:** Wicktrimmer's interest in collecting led him to negotiate a major deal with the Right for Riches Company for [[Larel's Pin]] and [[Larel's Dagger]]. His motivation was partly personal, as he wanted to prove the existence of the legendary Larel to his old friend [[Balthazar the Blue]].
- **Enemies of the Party:** He provided intelligence on the murder of [[Susarra]], attributing it to the [[Cult of Set]]. He also advised the party to be cautious of local politics involving [[Lady Alexia Basileon]], her half-brother [[Lord Iskander Burdock]], and the [[Drome]] in Narsileon, led by [[Keko the Lame]].
- **Teleportation:** He is extremely interested in acquiring a reliable method of long-range (400-mile) teleportation to improve his business logistics.
 
## Relationships
- [[Lady Alexia Basileon]]: mutual respect; aligned on town order and trade vitality.
- [[Right for Riches Company]]: frequent counterparties for artifact brokerage and financing.
- [[Balthazar the Blue]] and [[Lost and Found]]: former adventuring ties; continuing personal motivations.
- [[Drome]] of [[Narsileon]] and the [[Rarities Factor]] network: competitive intelligence and logistics sphere.
