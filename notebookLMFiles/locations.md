# Beacon

## Summary
The Beacon is a two-level base of operations that has been taken over by the party. Found notes strongly suggest that the Beacon is actually a "Vehicle," but its propulsion mechanism is currently unknown. It appears to require fuel, potentially a substance called [[Arcanum]].

It serves as a location for downtime activities and is accessed primarily via [[Rugs of Instant Access]].

## Technology & Functionality
Found notes found within the Beacon hint at its true nature and operation:
- **Vehicle Potential:** "Beacon = Vehicle - but how does it move?"
- **Fuel Requirement:** "Fuel is needed. [[Arcanum]] - for what?"
- **Operational Data:** A blackboard contains lists of stars and corresponding [[Rudishva glyphs]], as well as lists of letters and numbers, suggesting some form of navigation or control system.
- **Rudishva Rites Capability:** The Beacon currently lacks the ability to perform advanced [[Rudishva]] funeral rites such as "Full Recycling" and "Spacing."

## Access
- **Primary Access:** The party uses [[Rugs of Instant Access]] to travel between the Beacon and locations in town, such as the [[Arcane Practitioners' Club]].
- **Stairs:** There is a staircase leading out, but it is blocked by a thick stone cap covered in rubble. The bronze doors at the bottom of the stairs are password-protected.

## Layout & Features
The Beacon consists of two main areas across two levels:
- **Northern Area:** Features white marble floors and maintains a constant, comfortable temperature.
- **Southern Area:** Features gray granite floors and its temperature fluctuates with the outdoors. This area contains a lounge with comfortable furniture but can get very cold.

A stone door with a lock separates the two areas. The party does not possess the key and has relied on magic (`Lockmaster` spell) to open it.

### Keycard System
A system of oval keycards is used to operate doors:
- **Secret Closet:** A low-tech physical lock on a closet off the reading room can be opened by jamming any oval keycard into it.
- **Iris Doors:** The colored oval keycards (rust, brown, sky blue, pale green, orange) open the iris doors throughout the Beacon. The metallic keycards (copper, bronze, platinum) do not work for this.

## Amenities & Downtime
- **Downtime:** The Beacon can be used for various downtime activities, including:
    - Research using books found within the Beacon.
    - Language training with [[Akla-Chah]].
    - General base improvements.
- **Food & Drink:** A machine in [[Akla-Chah]]'s room dispenses "Arden Vul Cakes" and "Rudishva booze." It is unknown how long this will function.
- **Facilities:** There is no privy; party members must travel elsewhere (e.g., the [[Arcane Practitioners' Club]]) for facilities.

# Gosterwick

Gosterwick is a rapidly growing "boom town" located about 10 miles south of the ruins of [[Arden Vul]].

## History & Layout
Originally a tiny [[Thorcin]] farming village, [[Gosterwick]]'s expansion began approximately 20 years ago when the [[Archontean]] noblewoman [[Lady Alexia Basileon]] arrived along with a contingent of [[Knights of the Azure Shield]] and built the [[Azure Keep]]. The settlement then began to grow into a town of a couple thousand people. The [[Azure Keep]] is located in the northeast corner of the town by a lake.

The town's walls are not yet complete, consisting mostly of a marked-out dirt berm with two finished gatehouses. Most of the buildings are clustered in the northeast corner near the keep. To compensate for the lack of walls, large wooden guard houses have been erected in the emptier parts of town.

## Services & Points of Interest

Gosterwick offers a surprising number of services for its size, attracting adventurers and others seeking to make their fortune from the nearby ruins.

### Inns & Taverns

# Haunted Tower

## Description
A tower located at the base of the [[Waterfall]] near [[Arden Vul]].

## History
The tower was built during the [[Adrienic Expedition]], an attempt by [[Archon Phocion IV]] to retake [[Arden Vul]] about 250 years ago. The expedition failed bloodily, and the tower was abandoned.

## Inhabitants
- [[The Tower Ghost]]: The tower is haunted by an angry, wronged soul that screams of "Settite murderers."

## Notes

### From the Journal of Ioannes
> I found the record. The tower at the base of the waterfall—built during the Adrienic Expedition, two and a half centuries past. An attempt by Archon Phocion IV to retake Arden Vul. It failed. Bloodily. The tower was left behind when the survivors fled.
> And now it is haunted. Or rather, “folklore,” according to one too-convenient source.
>
> I do not trust him. He either never saw the ghost himself, or pretended not to.
>
> I did. The spirit that emerged from that cellar did not wander aimlessly or mutter incoherently. It screamed—accused. “Settite murderers,” it said. That is not a random haunt. That is a wronged soul. It is bound, and it is angry.
>
> This is not folklore. This is unfinished business.
>
> Demma teaches that proper rest follows proper ritual. Perhaps there is something to uncover: a hidden corpse, a desecrated relic, an oath unfulfilled. I will return. Not yet. But soon. And I will put it to rest.
>
> Gods grant that it is no demon. If it is, I will not face it alone.

# Pyramid of Thoth

## Summary
The [[Pyramid of Thoth]] is a major landmark in the surface ruins of [[Arden Vul]] and serves as a primary entrance to the dungeons beneath. It is a step pyramid, about 90' square and 45' high, and the largest intact structure in the city.

## Description
- **Surface Statue:** There stood a 20' tall statue of [[Thoth]] in ibis-headed form, with a body of purple porphyry stone and a head of white marble, with eyes of green jade. Curiously, while the body of the statue was massive, the arms looked relatively light and appeared to be mounted on pins so that they could rotate up and down. The pyramid was surrounded by purple porphyry columns, holding up a relatively small roof that protected the pyramid from the elements.
- **Entrances:** One rectangular section of the floor was a different color from the rest, and seemed to have a seam around it indicating that it might be able to move, but it sat flush and there were no handles visible so there was no obvious way to open it. Manipulating the statue's arms (pointing both arms forward) opened this door, revealing stairs heading down into the pyramid. There was a large handle on the bottom side of the door, allowing it to be moved from inside. Pointing both arms straight up at the sky produced an interesting result -- the floor panel slid the other way, revealing a different staircase going down into the pyramid in the opposite direction.
- **Artwork on Steps:** The first four steps had four different pictures, which then started repeating on the next few steps.
    1. An ibis-headed [[Thoth]] pointing both arms at a human descending stairs.
    2. An ibis-headed [[Thoth]] pointing his left arm at a human, who was bowing while presenting a plate of coins and scrolls.
    3. An ibis-headed [[Thoth]] puking out a long scroll with abstract writing (no actual words) into the hands of some humans.
    4. A baboon seated with a book on its thighs, holding a pen, and gazing at some humans while a feather appeared in the air. Identifying the baboon as another symbol of [[Thoth]] was easy, but naming the feather as the symbol of [[Maat|Thoth's wife Maat]] required a good Theology roll.
- **Nearby Well:** To the east of the pyramid, [[pcs/Vael Sunshadow|Vael]] discovered an interesting well. It was uncovered, about 5' wide, and its insides were covered with mirrors, such that the sun overhead produced blinding reflections. A [[Continual Light]] rock dropped into the well fell for several seconds, then stopped at the bottom, still making light, but reflections made details hard to see. There were no rungs in the well.

## Notes
- A rumor suggests that because this is the most well-known entrance, the areas immediately beneath it have been picked clean by other adventurers. It is suggested that the [[Well of Light]] might be a better entry point.
- Another rumor states that the Pyramid leads to the topmost of at least a dozen underground levels, which culminate in a huge cavern and lake at the bottom.
- Graffiti found inside the pyramid reads: "I told [[Robin]] not to touch the eyes. Now his picks are mine." This likely refers to the rumors about the dangerous gemstone eyes on statues of [[Thoth]].

# Shrine of Lucreon

## Summary
A shrine to the god [[Lucreon]] in [[Gosterwick]].

## Description
The shrine is a classic, three-chamber structure: an ante-cella for congregation, a cella for main rituals, and an unconnected postern with administrative offices and clergy apartments.

The main cultic object is a colossal granite statue of Lucreon, dressed as an Archontean factor associate, holding a massive bag of coins. An offering chest sits below the bag.

## The Mystery of Lucreon
The shrine is home to an impressive mystery: when a coin is dropped into the offering box, it magically appears in the air above the statue and falls into the god's money bag. The bag is emptied by the clerics each night.

# Temple of Demma

While there are many temples to [[Demma]], this page primarily describes the temple located in [[Gosterwick]].

## The Temple in Gosterwick

### Overview
The Temple of Demma in [[Gosterwick]] is a modest but well-maintained structure that serves as a center for healing, wisdom, and rural devotion. It prioritizes practical, service-oriented aid to the local farmers and rural poor over the town's more mercenary-driven economy. Its faithful are primarily farmers, midwives, and homemakers.

### Staff
- **Chief Priest:** [[Vivian]], a stern but fair Thorcin cleric.
- **Assisting Clerics:** Four clerics who manage daily rituals and services.
- **Temple Guard:** Six dedicated warriors known as [[Harvest Guardians]], who wield flails.

### Services
The temple provides blessings for fields and expectant mothers, as well as limited magical services like healing, which are offered first to true believers and those in genuine need.

## The Priesthood of Demma

### Structure
The priesthood is hierarchical yet practical. Local temples are led by a Chief Priest who manages the temple and its obligations.
- **[[Seedkeepers]]:** A more esoteric branch of the priesthood, dedicated to guarding ancient agricultural knowledge and sacred rites.
- **[[Harvest Guardians]]:** The warrior arm of the faith, tasked with defending temples and enforcing Demma's will. They are trained in the use of the flail.

### Vestments
Clergy wear practical vestments in earthy tones (greens, yellows, browns) with a sleeveless outer robe of deep red or russet. The flail is a prominent symbol, used both as a weapon and as a ceremonial object.

# Tower of Scrutiny

## Summary
A tower in [[Arden Vul]] that has served as a refuge and a point of intrigue throughout its history.

## Historical Note
A historical document, a letter from Archon [[Uriel Basileon]] to [[Kel Bormol]], Overseer of Thoth, reveals a past incident involving the tower. During a "[[Sortians|Sortian]] onslaught" that included "Sortian dragons," the Second Overseer of Thoth cowardly retreated and barricaded himself inside the Tower of Scrutiny, refusing entry to all.

Archon Basileon noted his intent to "smoke him out" and deliver him for punishment once the Sortian threat had passed. He also warned that his agents had seen a messenger from [[Hithra Paleologos]] gaining entrance to the tower, a development he considered ominous.

# Well of Light

## Summary
The [[Well of Light]] is a significant location in [[Arden Vul]], acting as both a source of light and a pathway to deeper levels.

## Description
- **General:** It is an uncovered well, about 5' wide, and its insides are covered with mirrors, such that the sun overhead produces blinding reflections.
- **Vael's Interaction:** [[pcs/Vael Sunshadow|Vael]] discovered an interesting well to the east of the [[Pyramid of Thoth]]. He dropped a [[Continual Light]] rock into the well during his first visit. It fell for several seconds, then stopped at the bottom, still making light, but reflections made details hard to see.
- **Access:** There are no rungs in the well, so the only way down is via [[Levitation]] or a long rope.
- **Condition:** The mirror at the bottom of the well was found covered in debris and baboon feces during a later visit, requiring cleaning.

## Level
Extends from the surface into the underground levels of [[Arden Vul]].
