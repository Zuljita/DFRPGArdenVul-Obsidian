// Example Quartz config that points content to the Obsidian vault.
// Copy this file into your `quartz/` folder and adjust as needed
// based on the Quartz version you are using.

// NOTE: Quartz evolves quickly. Field names may differ between versions.
// The key idea is to set the content path to `../vault`.

// import { defineConfig } from "quartz" // adjust to your version
// export default defineConfig({
//   content: {
//     // Use a relative path that points to the vault
//     path: "../vault",
//   },
//   build: {
//     outDir: "public",
//   },
//   // ... other site/theme settings as desired
// })

// If your Quartz version does not expose a config file, simply place the
// Quartz project in `quartz/` and the Obsidian content in `vault/` at the
// repository root so relative lookups resolve.
