# [[factions/Rudishva.md|Rudishva]] Funeral Rites

[[Vallium Halcyon]] and the party inquired with [[Akla-Chah]] about [[Rudishva]] burial/funeral rites, prompted by a [[glyph]] found on a stone seat and the presence of a [[corpse]].

## Funeral Traditions

[[Akla-Chah]] explained that the [[Rudishva]] have a few different funeral traditions, ranked by preference:

1.  **Full Recycling:**
    -   Considered the best method.
    -   The [[Beacon]] currently lacks the ability to perform this.
2.  **Spacing:**
    -   The second-best method.
    -   The [[Beacon]] currently lacks the ability to perform this either.
3.  **Cremation:**
    -   The third-best method.
    -   Might be practical if the party has the means to build a suitably hot fire, somewhere outside the [[Beacon]].
