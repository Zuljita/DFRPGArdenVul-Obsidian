# The [[items/Living Wheelbarrow.md|Living Wheelbarrow]] Project

[[Ashe Maykum|Ashe's]] [[Alcheboretal Animossities]] is raising funds for [[The Living Wheelbarrow]]!

Regular wheelbarrows are boring, can't be [[Levitation|levitated]], and are a hassle to haul around just to carry the loot. The [[The Living Wheelbarrow|LIVING wheelbarrow]] carries 360 pounds of AWESOME packed with so much plant life you'll look for excuses to [[Levitation|levitate]] it more often.

[[Ashe Maykum|Ashe "The GOAT" Maykum]] has complete his "Shroom for Improvement" prototype and [[The Living Wheelbarrow]] is ready for mass production.

[[The Living Wheelbarrow]] features an underside covered in real living plants, allowing the use of [[Levitation]] rather than [[Apportation]] to move it around. It can be pushed or pulled with only a quarter of the strength necessary to move a ground-based wheelbarrow, and ignores difficult terrain, easily raised or lowered across flights stairs or even vertical shafts through simple caster concentration.

The best part? It requires little more care than a house plant and can survive for days without sunlight.

Available in Fungus White, Moss Green and Yellow Rattle.

The [[The Living Wheelbarrow|Living Wheelbarrow]] is not self-powered, self-propelled or self-levitating. A competent caster and [[Levitation]] spell is required to make use of the levitating feature. [[Scroll]] use by untrained users may result in injury or equipment loss. All designs, components, and plant details are prototypes and are subject to change. Final design, colors, and materials may vary as we continue development and incorporate feedback. We're committed to delivering the best possible product and will keep you updated throughout the process.
