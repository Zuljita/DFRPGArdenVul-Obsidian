# Religion in Arden Vul

## Summary
The religious landscape of the [[Archontean Empire]] is diverse, with a state-sponsored pantheon, various other cultural pantheons, and fringe or illegal cults. The prominence of a deity's cult can vary significantly by location.

## Key Concepts
- **The Ten**: The ten major gods of the [[Archontean Empire]].
- **The Seventeen**: The seventeen minor gods of the [[Archontean Empire]].
- **The Twelve**: A group of twelve gods no longer sponsored by the [[Archontean Empire]].
- **Thorcin Pantheon**: The pantheon of the [[Thorcins]].
- **Wiskin Pantheon**: The pantheon of the [[Wiskin]], including [[Odin]].
- **Illegal Cults**: Worship of some deities, like [[Set]], is illegal.

## Religious Centers
- **Gosterwick**: Has full temples for [[Demma]], [[Heschius Ban]], [[Lucreon]], and [[Mitra]], with smaller shrines for other gods.
- **Newmarket**: A larger town with temples for all of [[The Ten]], several of [[The Seventeen]], most of the [[Thorcin Pantheon]], and the [[Wiskin]] god [[Odin]].
