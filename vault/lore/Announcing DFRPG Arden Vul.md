# Announcing DFRPG Arden Vul (2025-03-05)

## Campaign Overview

The GM decided to run a fantasy megadungeon campaign using "The Halls of Arden Vul" by Richard Barton, written for OSRIC (a variant of Advanced D&D First Edition). The adventure is noted for its huge size (1100+ pages), a well-developed world, and a challenging dungeon.

The campaign uses the Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game (DFRPG) as its base rule set, with specific modifications to character generation and experience point (XP) awards.

## Character Creation Rules (Summary)

- **Point Total:** 125 points for player characters (PCs).
- **Disadvantage Limit:** -25 points.
- **Sense of Duty (Adventuring Companions):** [-5] does not count against the disadvantage limit.
- **Quirk Limit:** -5 points.
- **Templates:** Uses "Five Easy Pieces" from Pyramid 3/113, which are 50-point mini-templates. PCs can afford three Pieces (or two with an expensive racial template). Disadvantage points embedded in a Piece count against the limit.
- **Playable Races:** Dwarves, Elves, Half-elves, Halflings, Humans, and [[Imperial Goblin]]s. Cat-folk, half-orcs, half-ogres, and gnomes are not allowed.
- **Languages:** Languages can be taken at Accented and Broken levels to save points.
- **Starting Money:** Per DFRPG rules, with options to buy [[Wealth]] or trade points for cash.
- **Equipment:** Standard DFRPG: Adventurers equipment is available at list price, except for plate armor (which does not exist in the setting). Some non-magical items can be requested from the GM. Special orders or magical equipment may require availability rolls or travel to larger cities.
- **Coinage:** Uses AD&D coin value ratios with a silver piece standard ($1 = 1 silver piece). A copper is $0.1, a gold is $10, and a platinum is $50.
- **Perks:** "[[Burdock's Valley Local]]" [1] grants extra rumors, an area map, and default [[Area Knowledge]] for the local area.

## Setting Introduction

-   **World Name:** [[Magae]].
-   **Major Power:** The [[Archontean Empire]].
-   **Historical Context:** The old [[Archontean Empire]] (analogous to ancient Rome) expanded across nearby islands and parts of [[Irthuin]]. 1200 years ago, a magical civil war led survivors to retreat to the home island of [[Mithruin]]. The current empire (analogous to Byzantium) is re-occupying old territories. [[Arden Vul]] was a frontier city destroyed in this civil war.
-   **Local Geography:** The play area is [[Burdock's Valley]] (90x80 miles), containing [[Arden Vul]], [[Gosterwick]] (half-day's march south of [[Arden Vul]]), [[Newmarket]] (3 days further south), six small villages, and a couple of castles. Most inhabitants are [[Thorcin]].

## Cultures

-   **[[Archonteans]]**: Rulers of the empire, Byzantine feel.
-   **[[Thorcin]]**: Local population in [[Irthuin]], conquered then independent, now conquered again.
-   **[[Wiskin]]**: Vikings from northern islands.
-   **[[Khumus]]**: Horse nomads from far to the west.
-   **[[Halflings]] & [[Imperial Goblin]]s**: Assimilated into the [[Archontean Empire]], though goblins are second-class citizens.
-   **[[Elves]] & [[Dwarves]]**: Independent, secretive kingdoms outside the Empire.

## Languages

- **Commonly Spoken Near [[Arden Vul]]**: [[Archontean]] (urban/ruling class) and [[Thorcin]] (rural/working class).
- **Ancient Archontean:** [[Mithric]] (dead as a native language, but used for magic, religion, and scholarship). Spellbooks and scrolls are written in [[Mithric]].
- **Racial Languages:** Elvish, Dwarvish.

## Religion

- **[[Archontean Pantheon]]**: Ten major gods and seventeen minor gods.
- **Gosterwick Temples (Full Clerics):**
    - [[Demma]] (goddess of fertility and crops)
    - [[Heschius Ban]] (god of power)
    - [[Lucreon]] (god of wealth and merchants)
    - [[Mitra]] (god of justice and contracts)
- **Other Deities:** Small shrines to other [[Archontean]] major/minor gods and [[Thorcin]] gods in [[Gosterwick]]. [[Newmarket]] has temples to all ten major [[Archontean]] gods, several minor ones, most of the [[Thorcin]] pantheon, and the [[Wiskin]] god [[Odin]].
- **Proscribed Gods:** [[Set]] (illegal worship), [[Horus]] (presumed dead, no spells for clerics).
- **Dwarves**: Monotheists.
- **Elves**: "Spiritual but not religious," lack clerics.
