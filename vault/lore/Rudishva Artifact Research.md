# [[factions/Rudishva.md|Rudishva]] Artifact Research

[[Uvash]] undertook research on [[Rudishva]] artifacts.

## Reading "[[Rudishva Devices]]" (the book)

- The book contains pictures of various [[Rudishva Devices|Rudishva devices]].
- Some of these pictures match items found by the party, allowing for their identification in the loot sheet.
- Experimenting with the devices might be safer if the warnings in the book are consulted first.
- The writing is confusing, and some devices look similar, leading to uncertainty in identification.
- It is suggested that others should repeat the research before handling items, prioritizing safety over speed.
