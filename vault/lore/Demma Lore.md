# Demma Lore

## Overview

The [[Temple of Demma]] in [[Gosterwick]] is a modest but well-maintained structure, standing as a place of healing, wisdom, and rural devotion. It is led by Chief Priest [[Vivian]], a stern but fair [[Thorcin]] cleric. He trains new clerics in the mysteries of [[Demma]], believing faith must be practical and service-oriented. The temple prioritizes aid to the rural poor and farmers. Assisting clerics manage daily rituals, bless fields and expectant mothers, and provide limited magical services.

[[Demma]]'s influence spans magic and mystery, but the [[Temple of Demma|temple]] in [[Gosterwick]] is deeply tied to fertility, crops, and households. Its faithful include farmers, midwives, and homemakers, who bring offerings of seeds, bread, and woven charms. The temple is guarded by six dedicated warriors, wielding [[Flail|flails]] in homage to the goddess. Scholars and traveling priests seeking lost magical knowledge remind that [[Demma]]'s influence extends far beyond fields and homes.

## Mythology

[[Demma]] is the Great Nurturer, the goddess who sowed the first seeds of life and ensures the cycles of growth, harvest, and renewal. She is said to have woven the world’s fertility into the land, her touch bringing forth golden fields, strong children, and thriving households. Ancient myths tell of how she stole the secret of magic from the void and planted it within the soil and stars, granting mortals the ability to shape the world through wisdom and will. Though gentle in her blessings, [[Demma]] is unyielding in her wrath—when the selfish hoard, the corrupt abuse, or the wasteful defile her gifts, her [[Flail|flail]] strikes with famine, blight, and barrenness. Worshipers believe that to understand [[Demma]]’s will is to understand the balance of nature, hearth, and spirit, for in her, all things flourish—but only if tended with care.

## Theology

The theology of [[Demma]] centers on balance, stewardship, and the sacred duty of cultivation—whether of land, family, or knowledge. She teaches that fertility and abundance are gifts, but only to those who nurture them with wisdom and toil. To plant without care, hoard without sharing, or wield magic recklessly is to invite ruin. Her faithful are called to protect the cycles of nature, strengthen households, and guide new life. Magic is seen as a seed of creation, meant to be cultivated responsibly. True wisdom comes not just from study, but from action.

## Vestments of the Clergy of Demma

The vestments of [[Demma]]’s clergy reflect her domains. Standard attire consists of a long tunic in earthy tones (deep greens, golden yellows, or rich browns) embroidered with intricate seed-like patterns. Over this, they wear a sleeveless outer robe or mantle, often dyed in deep red or russet. A broad, gold-threaded sash or belt is worn around the waist, adorned with woven charms, seed pouches, or small [[Flail|flail-shaped talismans]].

For ceremonial occasions, high-ranking priests don a hooded cloak fastened with a bronze or gold brooch in the shape of a seed. Their sacred weapon, the [[Flail|flail]], is often incorporated into their attire. [[Demma]]’s vestments are designed to be worn while working, reinforcing the belief that faith is meant to be lived.

[[Ioannes]]’ personal attire, with deep blue tunic, golden embroidery, and a red woolen cloak fastened with a [[Bronze Brooch]], is slightly more ornate, reflecting his scholarly leanings. However, his disheveled state, ink-stained fingers, and perpetually askew sash betray his absentminded nature.

## Structure of the Priesthood of Demma

The priesthood of [[Demma]] is hierarchical yet practical, structured to reflect emphasis on stewardship, growth, and responsibility.

At the local level, each [[Temple of Demma|temple]] is led by a Chief Priest, like [[Vivian]] in [[Gosterwick]]. They oversee a small council of assisting clerics who handle daily rituals, agricultural blessings, midwifery, and magical healing.

More esoteric branches, sometimes called “[[Seedkeepers]]”, guard ancient agricultural knowledge, sacred fertility rites, and the interplay between magic and the natural world.

Temples are also protected by dedicated warriors, known as [[Harvest Guardians]], who serve as defenders of the faith and enforcers of [[Demma]]’s justice. Each major [[Temple of Demma|temple]] has a contingent of six to twelve fighters, trained in [[Flail|flail combat]].
