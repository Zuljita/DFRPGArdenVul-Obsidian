# Wicktrimmer Negotiations and Research

This document details the interactions and research conducted by [[pcs/Vael Sunshadow|Vael]] and [[pcs/Ioannes Grammatikos Byzantios|Ioannes]] concerning [[Wicktrimmer]] and the [[Rarities Factor]], particularly regarding the sale of [[Larel's Pin]] and other artifacts, as well as general intelligence gathering.

## Initial Inquiry Regarding [[Arcanum]]

- [[Lyssandra Astorion|Lyssandra]] informs [[pcs/Vael Sunshadow|Vael]] and [[pcs/Ioannes Grammatikos Byzantios|Ioannes]] of a note from [[Wicktrimmer]] inquiring about a large quantity of [[Arcanum]] that reportedly showed up in their corner of town. He is interested in buying it.
- [[Lyssandra Astorion|Lyssandra]] expresses surprise, noting [[Wicktrimmer]] is not a wizard and wonders who he's trying to sell it to.
- [[pcs/Ioannes Grammatikos Byzantios|Ioannes]] asks about [[Wicktrimmer]]'s identity, learning he runs the [[Rarities Factor]] and is likely the second richest person in [[Gosterwick]], and definitely the richest [[goblin]].
- [[Lyssandra Astorion|Lyssandra]] advises being polite to [[Wicktrimmer]], as he is not someone to anger.
- [[pcs/Ioannes Grammatikos Byzantios|Ioannes]] asks [[Lyssandra Astorion|Lyssandra]] about [[Arcanum]], learning it's a magic orange metal found in [[Arden Vul]] used as a spell component, though she has never seen it.

## [[Wicktrimmer]]'s Offer to the [[Right for Riches Company]]

- [[Wicktrimmer]] sends a note to the [[Right for Riches Company]] stating he has reliable information they found magical artifacts of deep historical significance.
- He offers lifetime free banking at the [[Rarities Factor]] if his wizard identifies them as genuine and the company sells any to him.

## [[pcs/Vael Sunshadow|Vael]]'s Due Diligence and Negotiations

[[pcs/Vael Sunshadow|Vael]] initiates research into [[Wicktrimmer]], [[Lost and Found]], and the [[Rarities Factor]], wearing his [[Larel's Cloak]] and [[Amulet of Voice]]. [[pcs/Ioannes Grammatikos Byzantios|Ioannes]] and [[pcs/Vallium Halcyon|Vallium]] also contribute to intelligence gathering.

### Initial Research Findings (from GM)
- [[Wicktrimmer]] is a retired adventurer who used to plunder [[Arden Vul]] with a group called [[Lost and Found]].
- [[Lost and Found]] was led by the wizard [[Balthazar the Blue]] and the paladin [[Grimley]].
- [[Wicktrimmer]] founded the [[Rarities Factor]] in [[Gosterwick]] 12 years ago, expanding to [[Newmarket]] and [[Narsileon]].
- The [[Rarities Factor]] offers banking, letters, and mule caravans at slightly cheaper prices than competitors, with a smaller geographical range.
- [[Wicktrimmer]] is possibly the second richest person in [[Gosterwick]] and the richest [[goblin]].
- He is a collector of historical treasures and magic items.
- He is friends with important people like the [[Green Lady]].
- His reputation is solid; he seems to know everything in town, with various theories as to how.

### Visit to the [[Rarities Factor]]
- [[pcs/Vael Sunshadow|Vael]] and friends visit the [[Rarities Factor]]. [[Wicktrimmer]] asks his wizard, [[Ingimund of Arcturus]], to inspect a [[Larel's Pin|letter opener]].
- [[pcs/Vael Sunshadow|Vael]] warns of obfuscation on the item.
- [[Wicktrimmer]] asserts his job is to know of all magic items in [[Gosterwick]], implying magical means of detection. He notes the item was unusually confusing due to its concealing effect.
- The wizard casts Analyze Magic and destroys the [[Larel's Pin|letter opener]] (which was a disguised [[Larel's Pin]]).
- [[Wicktrimmer]] offers $20,000 plus free banking for life for the entire company, for [[Larel's Pin]].
- [[Wicktrimmer]] reveals his past as an adventurer; his party, [[Lost and Found]], reached the [[Obsidian Gates]] but not beyond. He became a merchant after his party leader, [[Balthazar the Blue]], retired due to marriage.
- He notes his dislike for baboons, and is impressed by the party's handling of them.
- He offers payment in gold, silver, platinum, gems, or a letter of deposit.

### [[pcs/Vael Sunshadow|Vael]]'s Counter-Proposal
[[pcs/Vael Sunshadow|Vael]] proposes:
- Sale of [[Larel's Pin]].
- Right of first refusal for their magic items (with exceptions for personal requests, bartering for unique goods/services, or paying adventuring companions).
- Willingness to inform [[Wicktrimmer]] of any items given or traded away.
- In return: $20,000 for [[Larel's Pin]].
- Concierge shopping services in [[Narsileon]], [[Newmarket]], and other agent locations at [[Wicktrimmer]]'s cost.
- Free banking with the [[Rarities Factor]].
- Reports on enemies in town, especially the [[Cult of Set]].

### [[Wicktrimmer]]'s Response to Counter-Proposal
- [[Wicktrimmer]] accepts the proposal as a first draft, advising them not to sell any other found items and to include less valuable items for his collection.
- He expresses personal interest in [[Larel's Mom's Rabbit Soup Recipe]] and other [[Larel]] artifacts, wanting to prove [[Larel]]'s existence to [[Balthazar the Blue]].
- He reveals that [[Lady Alexia Basileon]] and a noble in [[Narsileon]] already hold rights of first and second refusal, respectively.
- He offers a "right of third refusal" in exchange for a reliable [[Teleporter with 400 Mile Range|teleporter with 400 mile range]] or a [[Fast Flying Carpet|fast flying carpet]], citing the inefficiency of mule trains.
- He confirms that concierge shopping services are possible for specific items, with messages reaching [[Narsileon]] in less than a day, but item delivery at mule train speed (around a month). Analyze Magic costs would be on the party.

### Further Research and Political Intel
- [[pcs/Vael Sunshadow|Vael]] and [[pcs/Ioannes Grammatikos Byzantios|Ioannes]] research [[Lost and Found]] and the [[Rarities Factor]].
- **[[Lost and Found]]**: Had unbelievable, possibly made-up exploits. [[Balthazar the Blue]] was big on self-promotion.
- **[[Rarities Factor]]**: Story of [[Wicktrimmer]] owning it seems doubtful; likely a rich noble behind the scenes.
- [[Wicktrimmer]] provides intel on [[Susarra]]'s murder, suggesting an out-of-town [[Cult of Set|Settite]] or hired assassin.
- He mentions [[Keko the Lame]], head of the [[Drome]] in [[Narsileon]], who might pin a medal on them for eradicating the [[Cult of Set]] in [[Arden Vul]].
- He warns of political complexities between [[Lady Alexia Basileon]] and her half-brother, leading to confusion in the Imperial chain of command regarding the [[Drome]] branches.
- He advises caution against assassins and recommends not sleeping in [[Arden Vul]] and not splitting up. If necessary, use 2 guards and Mystic Mist.
- He confirms [[Balthazar the Blue]] now lives in [[Narsileon]], raising kids and making potions, rarely visiting [[Gosterwick]]. [[Wicktrimmer]] visits [[Narsileon]] occasionally but manages the branch remotely.

### Larel Artifacts Provenance Statement (Drafted by [[pcs/Vael Sunshadow|Vael]])

An Account of the Discovery within the [[Thothian Necropolis]], by [[pcs/Vael Sunshadow|Vael Sunshadow]]

"It is a rare privilege to uncover a secret that history has forgotten, and a rarer one still to prove a legend true. Such was our fortune in the deep and silent precincts of the [[Thothian]] halls.

Our explorations led us to a series of forgotten ceremonial chambers, far from the notice of other delvers. We found ourselves in what appeared to be a minor funereal complex. The antechambers were as expected for a minor [[Thothian]] complex, but one sealed door led not to a simple crypt, but to the true prize: the final resting place of a figure many believed to be a myth. There could be no doubt; the walls were dominated by frescos of [[Larel]] himself, depicted in his iconic green cap and with his famous [[Larel's Dagger|dagger]]. The surrounding walls brought his tales to life in painted scenes: [[Larel]] distracting wolves with a chicken, concealing himself from an angry husband, and cleverly spiking apples on his dagger while performing a card trick.

Rather than being interred in a sarcophagus as is common among [[Thothian]]s, the hero's effects were laid out on racks in the chamber, as if waiting for his return. A small rack held a collection of fine, wicked-looking daggers, many with magical auras. Upon a writing desk lay a golden apple next to a simple silver '[[Larel's Pin|letter opener]]'—which we immediately recognized as [[Larel's Pin|Larel's legendary pin]]—alongside three identical love notes to differently named women. In the center of the room, a capped urn rested upon a stone pedestal, containing what can only be the hero's ashes."
