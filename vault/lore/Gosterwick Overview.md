## General Information

This document compiles various pieces of information regarding the town of [[Gosterwick]], its inhabitants, services, and recent events.

## Key Personalities and Services

- **[[Torunn the Smith]]**: A big [[Wiskin]] woman, renowned as the best smith in [[Gosterwick]]. She makes metal weapons and armor, distinguishing between Good, Fine, Balanced, and Dwarven quality. She has several apprentices, handling "The Good Stuff" herself.
- **[[Shrine of Lucreon]]**: A classic, three-chamber structure. The ante-cella (front) for congregation, the cella (middle) for main rituals, and the postern (back, unconnected) for administrative offices and clergy apartments. The main cultic object is a colossal granite statue of [[Lucreon]], holding a money bag. A magical mystery causes coins dropped into an offering chest to appear in the air and fall into the statue's bag. Clerics empty the bag nightly.

## Town Overview

- **History**: Originally a tiny [[Thorcin]] farming village, it grew into a town of a couple thousand people after [[Lady Alexia Basileon]] established the [[Azure Keep]] 20 years ago.
- **Layout**: Walled keep in the northeast by a lake. Walls are mostly a dirt berm with two gatehouses. Most buildings are near the keep, with isolated buildings like stables and [[Arcane Practitioners' Club]]. Large wooden guard houses are in empty areas.
- **Services**: Many for a small town: several inns, 4 full temples, small shrines, an [[Archontean]]-style bathhouse, bars, government buildings, pawn shop, money changer, banking factors, and a bookseller.
- **Economy**: Has the feel of a boom town, with significant money flowing into the area, drawing people to [[Gosterwick]].
