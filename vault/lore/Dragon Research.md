# Dragon Research

## Ioannes' Research Project

[[Ioannes]] brewed a [[Flight Potion|Flight potion]] and researched a dragon.

### Research Findings:

An account from about 50 years ago details an encounter in the [[Arden Vul|ruins of Arden Vul]] involving a huge green dragon. A group of the late [[Lord Burdock]]'s men-at-arms climbed the [[cliff face]] to explore the ruins. They met a huge green [[Dragons|dragon]], and 10 out of the 12 men, including three knights, died. The only survivors were two young men who were kept back to hold horses, and they lost most of the horses and baggage as they fled.

[[Lord Burdock]] then forbade any more of his subjects from going up the [[Long Stair]] to the ruins, lest they anger the [[Dragons|dragon]] further. He also discouraged outsiders from using the [[Burdock Valley]] as a base for exploration of the ruins. This effectively limited exploration of the ruins until his death 25 years ago.
