# Sortians Research

[[Ioannes]] researches the eyes that activate statues.

## Findings from the [[Library of Thoth]] (Back stacks of the Library of Mitra)

Ioannes finds a very old book about the ancient [[Sortians]], who were traitors under [[Priscus Pulcher]]. They rebelled against the natural order of having magic controlled by approved churches and colleges, advocating for allowing anyone with magical aptitude to cast spells. This rebellion caused the [[Civil War]] and the abandonment of the [[Exarchate of Narsileon]], setting the [[Archontean Empire|Empire]] back a thousand years.

Among their "sins" were:
- Summoning [[demons]].
- Letting women and elves hold leadership positions.
- Creating "graven images" or magical statues of their vain leader [[Priscus Pulcher]] for worship.

One confirmed ritual involved inserting magical eyes of various types into the eye holes of these statues, with effects such as:
- Passing messages.
- Teleportation.
- Causing nearby children to disobey their parents.

The author of the book advises funding a mission to find and destroy any surviving [[Sortian]] statues and eyes to prevent their use for evil.

## Discussion on the Sortian Civil War

- The [[Civil War]] was long, and "everyone lost." However, the [[Archontean Empire|Empire]] survived, albeit with smaller borders.
- Spell use was eventually opened up.
- Some old churches lost power, and new ones took their place.
- [[Priscus Pulcher]] and the [[Sortians]] are still remembered as traitors, though many are unclear on the specifics.

## The Philosopher Statue

- The "Philosopher" is a generic figure.
- [[Priscus Pulcher]] was an actual historical figure.
- He did look similar to "The Philosopher" later in his life, but it's unclear which came first.
