# Ptarmis Research

## Ioannes' Inquiry

[[Ioannes]] inquired about available [[minor healing potions]] in [[Gosterwick]], prompting a suspicious look from [[Freydis the Stern]], who noted the frequency of such requests.

## Research on Ptarmis

[[Ioannes]] then conducted research on [[Ptarmis]], learning the following:

- [[Ptarmis]] was a famous [[Thothian]] priest from long ago, active in the early days of [[Arden Vul]].
- He is credited with discovering the [[Great Cavern]] and bringing it under [[Archontean]] control.
- He apparently also bred [[giant mushrooms]].
- One source claims he left his family and church behind to live with his mushrooms, "like some kind of weird Druid."
