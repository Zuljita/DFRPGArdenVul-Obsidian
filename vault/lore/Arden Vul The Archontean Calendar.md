# Arden Vul: The Archontean Calendar (2025-03-08)

This document describes the structure and unique characteristics of the [[Archontean Calendar]], as it functions within the [[Magae]] world setting of [[Arden Vul]].

## Calendar Structure

-   **Months:** 12 months, each with exactly 30 days.
-   **Year Length:** The year on [[Magae]] is 372 days (compared to Earth's 365/365.25 days).
-   **Intercalary Periods:** To account for the 372-day year, two 6-day intercalary periods are added:
    -   **Mercedonian Days (Days of Wages):** Occurs right after the New Year.
    -   **Voluptarian Days (Days of Pleasure):** Occurs two-thirds of the way through the year, between the eighth and ninth month, coinciding with the harvest festival. This asymmetrical placement makes "faux-historical sense" given typical harvest times.

## Days of the Week

The week consists of seven days, each named after a deity or celestial body:

-   **Basilsday:** Named for the [[Emperor]].
-   **Lunday:** Named for the [[Moon]].
-   **Tothsday:** Named for [[Thoth]] (a Greater God of the old pantheon, no longer popular).
-   **Mitrasday:** Named for [[Mitra]] (a god of the new pantheon).
-   **Tahsday:** Named for [[Ptah]] (a god of the old pantheon).
-   **Horasday:** Named for [[Horus]] (a god of the old pantheon, unpopular and possibly dead).
-   **Demmasday:** Named for [[Demma]] (a goddess of the new pantheon).

## Translation and GM Notes

-   The different year lengths and intercalary periods complicate direct translation between real-world and game-world calendars.
-   The GM typically "wings it" by syncing game seasons with real seasons and using real-world weather analogs.
-   Dates are primarily used for seasonal weather and tracking weekly game progression (as PCs usually delve once a week).
-   The "silly jumble of historical accidents" in the calendar, particularly the inconsistent naming of days, is noted as a realistic touch for a fictional world.
