## PC Rumors

### From [[pcs/Vael Sunshadow|Vael]] (Kyle)

#### Vael Rumor 1
"The priests of [[Temple of Mitra|Mitra]] are looking for some chumps to track down one of their missing clergy, a priestess named [[Lillian]]. It seems she went missing by that [[Huge Overgrown Thicket]] down near the cliff of [[Arden Vul]]. We ran into a shepherd who claims he saw her being taken by walking pigs up the cliff into the ruins of [[Arden Vul]]. If you can find and return this [[Lillian]], there's a big reward posted in [[Newmarket]]."

#### Vael Rumor 2
"[[Thoth]] was deeply important to the ancient [[Archontean Empire|empire]], as he represented the light of knowledge that erased the darkness of ignorance. For this reason, the [[Thoth]] priests were obsessed with light; every one of their [[Halls of Thoth|Halls]] remains brightly lit with [[Thoth]]'s bright, clear, light."

### From [[Archon Shiva]] (Grudge Brigade)

#### Rumor 1
"A [[Massive Road|massive road]], built for creatures larger than humans, runs for a mile through the caverns. If you can get on it, you’ll be able to reach the [[goblin king]] and the [[Troll Thegn|troll thegn]]."

#### Rumor 2
"The caverns under [[Arden Vul]] produced a large supply of a wondrous [[Orange Mineral|orange mineral]] that proved to have very many arcane uses. The [[Arden Vul|city]] was abandoned when the mines ran dry."

#### Rumor 3 (Gog)
"[[Gog]] is this barmy old [[goblin]] who lives in an underground grotto near the [[Arena]]. He's eager to barter information for meat, especially [[Beastman|beastman]] meat. If you do, he'll tell you a sob-story about how he was exiled from the [[goblin court]] due to the treachery of another [[goblin]] named [[Mook]]."

#### Rumor 4 (Thoth)
"[[Thoth]] may have represented the light of knowledge, but he was also the guardian of secrets. He favored those who acquired and guarded knowledge, and himself only revealed the most potent of his wisdom to the devout. There is said to be a chamber in the [[Upper Halls]] where, if one listens through an enormous horn, one can hear [[Thoth]] speak directly."

#### Rumor 5 (Eighth Level Grotto)
"On the [[Eighth Level Grotto of Singing Heads|eighth level underground]] you can find a grotto filled with giant carved heads. The heads sing in recognizable tunes! If you can get them to sing the right tune, they reveal a treasure vault. If they sing the wrong song, however, everyone dies."

#### Rumor 6 (Cult of Set)
"The ancient [[Cult of Set]] was known for its belief in the natural right of the strong to dominate the weak. As a central part of this dogma, it operated its own slave trade, which it called 'the [[Settite Guild of Service]]'."

#### Rumor 7 (Set Priests as Slavers)
"The [[Cult of Set|Set]] priests are slavers. Anyone they encounter on the [[Long Stair]]s leading to their [[Forum of Set]] is liable to be enslaved. If you make it to the [[Forum of Set]], though, you're safe."

#### Rumor 8 (Pyramid of Thoth)
"The [[Pyramid of Thoth]] in the ruined city leads directly to the topmost of the many underground levels; beneath it are at least a dozen other levels, culminating in a [[Great Cavern|huge cavern]] and lake at the bottom."

#### Rumor 9 (Kraken in Chasm)
"At the foot of the [[Great Chasm]] is a huge cistern the size of a lake. The cistern is 100' deep and covers the area of a small town. It is ruled by a terrible [[kraken]]."

#### Rumor 10 (Imperial Span)
"[[Marius Tricotor]] had his sorcerers create a magical bridge out of stone. This bridge, called the [[Imperial Span]], crossed the [[Great Chasm]], and allowed the archon's troops to move into the lower levels."

#### Rumor 11 (Drowned Canyon)
"Everyone talks about the [[Drowned Canyon]] and all its wealth, but I don’t know an adventurer who admits to actually having found the damned canyon! The entire thing is a myth."

#### Rumor 12 (Thoth Statues)
"The [[Thoth]] priests built numerous statues of their god. These appear in various forms, including ibis-headed and baboon-headed. The eyes of all these statues were made of huge gemstones, which if removed allowed the bearer to contact [[Thoth]] directly. Many of the statues were enchanted."

### From [[pcs/Vallium Halcyon|Vallium Halcyon]] (Greybrown)

#### Carousing Rumor (Lord Burdock)
[[pcs/Vallium Halcyon|Vallium Halcyon]] hears from [[Azgallatu]] the cleric (who was in [[Newmarket]] with [[Lillian]] but is back in [[Gosterwick]]) that [[Lord Iskander Burdock]] ([[Lady Alexia Basileon|Lady Alexia's]] half brother) has been recruiting adventurers to delve into the [[Halls of Arden Vul|Halls]]. He's been offering equipment in exchange for a 50/50 split of the treasure.

#### Rumor 1 (Crazy Hermit)
"We met a crazy hermit in the ruins of the [[Arden Vul|city]]. His stew is foul, but if you eat with him, he'll give you some good directions. For instance, there's a staircase hidden behind a painted image of a baboon; it leads down to what the hermit called 'the scene of the crime'."

#### Rumor 2 (Magical Energy Source)
"A unique source of magical energy exists inside the plateau, drawing both creatures and inquisitive mages. It can be manipulated by powerful mages for good ... or for ill. Look for the [[Orange Mineral|orange rocks]]."

#### Rumor 3 (Troll Market & Bedara)
"We were waiting to take the lift down to the [[Troll Market]] when a huge [[Troll]] exiting the lift asked us a question in surprisingly good [[Thorcin]]! It wanted to know if we had seen one of its fellow hunters, a [[Troll]] named [[Bedara]]. When we said no, the [[Troll]] spat and wouldn't say another word. I got the feeling that they'd be real friendly if you could find this [[Bedara]]."

#### Rumor 4 (Adrienic Expedition & Cavern of Blood)
"Some 250 years ago the emperor sent six cohorts of legionaries, five from the [[Sheepshead Rangers]] and one from his own guards tagmata, to recolonize [[Arden Vul]]. All six cohorts were lost in a battle fought at the '[[Cavern of Blood]]'. What is worse, their battle standards were also lost. The archon who led the expedition, a certain [[Adrienic]] (presumably [[Archon Phocion IV]]), committed suicide rather than report his failure."

#### Rumor 5 (Hall of Forty Pillars & Obsidian Gates)
"The [[Hall of Forty Pillars]] is right next to the [[Obsidian Gates]]. The hall is filled with these creepy albino toads. If the wrong person touches the Gates, the toads turn into demons and attack."

#### Rumor 6 (Ptarmis' Secret Tomb)
"The great [[Thothian]] wizard, [[Ptarmis]], built himself a secret tomb amid a huge forest of colossal mushrooms. We found the [[Fungus Cavern]] on the second level from the surface, but were driven back before we could locate the tomb by some [[Sheep-headed Critters]] wielding swords and spears."

#### Rumor 7 (Plummie the Halfling Thug)
"A psychotic [[Halfling]] thug named [[Plummie]], [[Plumit]], or Plum-something has taken over the top level, just under the [[Pyramid of Thoth]]. He won't let anyone pass unless they buy an 'exploration license'. I'd pay up, because his goons are armed with potent magic wands."

#### Rumor 8 (Dragon Ruler of Surface Ruins)
"A terrible [[Dragons|dragon]] is the ruler of the surface ruins of [[Arden Vul]]. To access the [[dungeons]] you need to sneak past her in the dead of the night, when she's sleeping. I've heard that she extorts a toll on all those she catches exiting the [[Halls of Arden Vul|Halls]]. If you can't pay, she burns you up."

#### Rumor 9 (Drowned Canyon & Waterfall)
"To find the [[Drowned Canyon]] you gotta follow the water, right? I knew an adventurer named [[Leofwin Rufus]] who told me that all you had to do was locate the [[Waterfall]] in the [[Great Chasm]] and then follow the river back to the canyon. Easy as pie!"

#### Rumor 10 (Green Dragon Daughter of Wyrm)
"The green [[Dragons|dragon]] that rules the surface ruins is the daughter of a terrible [[wyrm]] that lives at the bottom of the [[Great Chasm]] within the mountain. This ancient [[wyrm]] is twice as old and twice as potent as the green; it is served by a race of deathless, horned skeletons whom the old [[Archontean Empire|Empire]] referred to as 'the [[Survivors of the Stone|survivors]]'."

#### Rumor 11 (Gog the Half-Troll)
"It’s worth trying to get information from anyone who is willing to talk. Most intelligent sorts will be willing to parlay, and a few have seriously good info! Look for a strange half-troll called [[Gog]] - he’ll steer you right. It’s the non-intelligent things that you have to watch out for."

#### Rumor 12 (Ibis-God Statues)
"The precincts of the ibis-god are littered with these creepy statues, all of which have eyes made out of huge gemstones. If you try to remove the eyes, the statues animate and wreak bloody vengeance."

#### Rumor 13 (The Forum & Stephania)
"I saw some dodgy-looking tinkers and trademen making their way for something they called The Forum saying that [[Stephania]] paid good money for the most basic supplies. They said 'if you want to go to The Forum, shine two lanterns from the left side of the river at night-time. Then look for the basket on the [[Cliff Face|cliff face]].'"

#### Rumor 14 (Shining Well)
"Everyone uses the old [[Pyramid of Thoth]] to enter the [[Halls of Thoth|halls]] (by the way, check out the gems used for that statue's eyes! My party leader wouldn't let me grab 'em. Superstitious fool). But because everyone uses that entrance, the areas beneath the [[Pyramid of Thoth]] have already been picked clean. I'd suggest finding another route - I heard there was a [[Shining Well]] that leads straight to the sweet loot."

#### Rumor 15 (Goblin City & Great Chasm)
"There’s a [[Goblintown|goblin city]] in the middle levels somewhere. The main entrance is a huge iron gate built into the wall of that [[Great Chasm]] that extends down into the depths. Find the great stone seat near [[Sundered Span]], and you can rappel down from there. But be sure to bring tribute, as the [[goblin king]] requires a suitable gift to let you in."

#### Rumor 16 (Archon Tombs & Julian Grex)
"Most of the archons of [[Arden Vul]] built their tombs under the [[Arden Vul|city]], in odd corners of the [[Halls of Arden Vul|Halls]]. So it’s best to keep an eye out for strange construction and secret passages. I’ve heard that the tomb of [[Julian Grex]] is located within a [[Underground Almond Grove|grove of underground almond trees]]."

#### Rumor 17 (Escaped Slaves & Guild of Service)
"We were drinking some of that mushroom ale in the [[Forum of Set]] when we overheard some of the red guardsmen whispering about some escaped slaves causing problems to the north. When we offered help, they turned officious and claimed there was no such thing - nobody escaped the [[Settite Guild of Service]]."

### From [[pcs/Vael Sunshadow|Vael]] (Kyle) - Additional

#### Graffiti on the Stairs
Graffiti on the stairs in the [[Pyramid of Thoth]]: "I told [[Robin]] not to touch the eyes. Now his picks are mine." Language: [[Archontean]].

### From [[pcs/Uvash Edzuson|Uvash]] (Cosmo)

#### [[Gedrick Malachite]]'s Warning
[[Gedrick Malachite]] says that [[doppelgangers]] have been showing up here. He also tells to give every [[Dwarf]] a good look over, as they might be a [[doppelganger]].
