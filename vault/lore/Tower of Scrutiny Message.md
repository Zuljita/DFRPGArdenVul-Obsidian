# Tower of Scrutiny Message

## Message from [[Uriel Basileon]] to [[Kel Bormol]]

"In answer to the pious inquiry of [[Kel Bormol]], Overseer of [[Thoth]], [[Uriel Basileon]], most humble [[Archon]], offers this reply. Your assistant, the [[Second Overseer]], has not dared show himself since of his cowardly retreat before the [[Sortian]] onslaught. He cowers within the [[Tower of Scrutiny]], refusing entry to all. Should conditions improve, and should the [[Sortian]] [[Dragons|dragons]] depart, I shall smoke him out of his lair, and deliver him to you for punishment. I should warn you, furthermore, that my agents have noticed a messenger from [[Hithra Paleologos]] obtaining entrance to the [[Tower of Scrutiny]]. I know not what this portends, but it cannot be good. Be warned.”
