# Cult of [[npcs/Set.md|Set]] Research

## Ioannes' Research Project
[[Ioannes]] undertook a hurried research project on the [[Cult of Set]].

### Findings:
- [[Set]] was a [[Greater God]] of the old pantheon, the Ten. His domains included power, knowledge, domination, slavery, vengeance, and serpents.
- Followers of [[Set]] were known for their [[Was sticks]], [[Set Animals]] (weird mean dogs with square ears), and [[Set Armor|red scale armor]].
- A [[Temple of Set]] was known to exist in [[Arden Vul]].
- Worship of [[Set]] was banned by imperial decree in 1839 AEP, over a thousand years ago.
- The [[Drome]] claimed to have successfully eliminated the cult everywhere in the Empire shortly after the ban.
- A [[Forum of Set]] allegedly exists in the ruins of [[Arden Vul]] to this day.
- Rumors persist that the [[Settite Guild of Service]] is still buying and selling slaves.

### Ioannes' Earlier Finding (Breeding Project):
- An ancient rescript from the high priest of [[Set]] to his counterpart in [[locations/Archontos.md|Archontos]] claims that the [[Temple of Set]] in [[Arden Vul]] succeeded in breeding a fearsome species of animals that 'shared all the attributes of Lord [[npcs/Set.md|Set]].'
- This project was based in a secret cavern located near the [[Waterfall]].
- The creature in question was presumably a kind of [[golem]].
