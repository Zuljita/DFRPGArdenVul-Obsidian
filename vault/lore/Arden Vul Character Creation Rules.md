# Arden Vul Character Creation Rules (2025-03-06)

This document outlines the specific rules for character creation in the DFRPG Arden Vul campaign, building upon the Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game (DFRPG) base rules.

## Core Character Generation
- **Base System:** Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game (DFRPG) is the base rules set. Anything from the rest of GURPS requires GM approval.
- **Starting Points:** 125 points.
- **Disadvantage Limit:** -25 points.
- **Sense of Duty (Adventuring Companions) [-5]:** This specific disadvantage does not count against the limit.
- **Quirk Limit:** -5 points.

## "Five Easy Pieces" Template System
- **Method:** Uses the "Five Easy Pieces" character generation option from Pyramid 3/113 (also available in GCS).
- **Mini-Templates:** Consists of 50-point mini-templates.
- **Affordability:** With the given point budget (125 + 25 + 5 + 5 = 160 points effective), PCs can typically afford three 50-point "Pieces," or two if an expensive racial template is chosen.
- **Disadvantage Points:** Disadvantage points embedded within a Piece *do* count against the overall disadvantage limit.
- **Leftover Points:** Any remaining points can be spent on abilities within the chosen Pieces, or on general abilities not restricted to specific templates in DFRPG.
    - Most attributes, skills, and advantages are generally purchasable by any character.
    - Some abilities are reserved for specific templates (e.g., Halfling Marksmanship for [[Halflings]], Turning for Clerics). Players are advised to ask the GM if unsure.

## Playable Races and Languages

- **Available Racial Templates:** Dwarf, Elf, Half-Elf, [[Halfling]], Human, and [[Imperial Goblin]].
- **Unavailable Races:** Cat-folk, half-orcs, half-ogres, gnomes.
- **Native Languages (per race):**
    - **Human:** Choose from [[Archontean]], [[Thorcin]], [[Wiskin]], or [[Khumus]]. Default is [[Archontean]] if none chosen.
    - **Elf:** [[Elvish]].
    - **Half-Elf:** Choose from [[Archontean]], [[Thorcin]], [[Wiskin]], [[Khumus]], or [[Elvish]]. Can take a second native language if raised in both cultures.
    - **Dwarf:** [[Dwarvish]].
    - **[[Halfling]]**: [[Archontean]].
    - **[[Imperial Goblin]]**: [[Archontean]].

- **Important Languages in the Area:**
    - **[[Archontean]]**: More urban and ruling class.
    - **[[Thorcin]]**: More rural and working class.
    - **[[Mithric]]**: The language of the ancient [[Archontean Empire]], currently a "dead" native language but essential for magic, some religions, and scholars. Spellbooks and scrolls are written in [[Mithric]], so mages and clerics should know it.
- **Language Levels:** Allowed to take languages at Accented or Broken levels for fewer points (using GURPS Basic Set rules in GCS).

## Equipment and Economy

- **Starting Equipment:** Per DFRPG rules. Can buy [[Wealth]] or trade points for cash at the start.
- **Available Equipment:** Any non-magical equipment from DFRPG: Adventurers (excluding plate armor, which does not exist in the setting). GM approval needed for common non-magical items not listed.
- **Post-Start Equipment:** Special orders and magical equipment may not be reliably available, possibly requiring availability rolls, travel to major cities, or hiring an enchanter.
- **Coinage:** Uses AD&D coin value ratios with a silver piece standard.
    - **Copper:** $0.1
    - **Silver:** $1
    - **Electrum:** $5 (rarely used)
    - **Gold:** $10
    - **Platinum:** $50
    - PCs can largely use GURPS dollars and ignore exact coins unless weight is a factor. Coins are available in GCS under Home Brew / Arden Vul Equipment.

## Perks

- **[[Burdock's Valley Local]] [1]:** A new perk. If taken, the PC has lived in the [[Burdock's Valley]] area long enough to gain extra rumors, an area map, and default [[Area Knowledge]]. PCs without this perk arrive as outsiders and must ask NPCs for directions.
