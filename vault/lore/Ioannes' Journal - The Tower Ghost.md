### The Tower Ghost

I found the record. The [[Haunted Tower|tower]] at the base of the [[Waterfall]]—built during the [[Adrienic Expedition]], two and a half centuries past. An attempt by [[Archon Phocion IV]] to retake [[Arden Vul]]. It failed. Bloodily. The [[Haunted Tower|tower]] was left behind when the survivors fled.
And now it is haunted. Or rather, “folklore,” according to one too-convenient source.

I do not trust him. He either never saw the ghost himself, or pretended not to.

I did. The spirit that emerged from that cellar did not wander aimlessly or mutter incoherently. It screamed—accused. “[[Cult of Set|Settite]] murderers,” it said. That is not a random haunt. That is a wronged soul. It is bound, and it is angry.

This is not folklore. This is unfinished business.

[[Demma]] teaches that proper rest follows proper ritual. Perhaps there is something to uncover: a hidden corpse, a desecrated relic, an oath unfulfilled. I will return. Not yet. But soon. And I will put it to rest.

Gods grant that it is no demon. If it is, I will not face it alone.
