## Reflections on The Tower Ghost
[[Ioannes]] encountered the ghost haunting the [[Haunted Tower]] at the base of the [[Waterfall]]. He concluded that the spirit, which screams accusations of "Settite murderers," is not a random haunt but a "wronged soul" with "unfinished business." Drawing on the teachings of [[Demma]] that proper rest follows proper ritual, Ioannes intends to return to the tower to uncover what binds the ghost—a hidden corpse, a desecrated relic, or an unfulfilled oath—and put it to rest, hoping it is not a demon.
