# Well of Light

## Summary
The [[Well of Light]] is a significant location in [[Arden Vul]], acting as both a source of light and a pathway to deeper levels.

## Description
- **General:** It is an uncovered well, about 5' wide, and its insides are covered with mirrors, such that the sun overhead produces blinding reflections.
- **Vael's Interaction:** [[pcs/Vael Sunshadow|Vael]] discovered an interesting well to the east of the [[Pyramid of Thoth]]. He dropped a [[Continual Light]] rock into the well during his first visit. It fell for several seconds, then stopped at the bottom, still making light, but reflections made details hard to see.
- **Access:** There are no rungs in the well, so the only way down is via [[Levitation]] or a long rope.
- **Condition:** The mirror at the bottom of the well was found covered in debris and baboon feces during a later visit, requiring cleaning.

## Level
Extends from the surface into the underground levels of [[Arden Vul]].
