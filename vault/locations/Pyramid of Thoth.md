# Pyramid of Thoth

## Summary
The [[Pyramid of Thoth]] is a major landmark in the surface ruins of [[Arden Vul]] and serves as a primary entrance to the dungeons beneath. It is a step pyramid, about 90' square and 45' high, and the largest intact structure in the city.

## Description
- **Surface Statue:** There stood a 20' tall statue of [[Thoth]] in ibis-headed form, with a body of purple porphyry stone and a head of white marble, with eyes of green jade. Curiously, while the body of the statue was massive, the arms looked relatively light and appeared to be mounted on pins so that they could rotate up and down. The pyramid was surrounded by purple porphyry columns, holding up a relatively small roof that protected the pyramid from the elements.
- **Entrances:** One rectangular section of the floor was a different color from the rest, and seemed to have a seam around it indicating that it might be able to move, but it sat flush and there were no handles visible so there was no obvious way to open it. Manipulating the statue's arms (pointing both arms forward) opened this door, revealing stairs heading down into the pyramid. There was a large handle on the bottom side of the door, allowing it to be moved from inside. Pointing both arms straight up at the sky produced an interesting result -- the floor panel slid the other way, revealing a different staircase going down into the pyramid in the opposite direction.
- **Artwork on Steps:** The first four steps had four different pictures, which then started repeating on the next few steps.
    1. An ibis-headed [[Thoth]] pointing both arms at a human descending stairs.
    2. An ibis-headed [[Thoth]] pointing his left arm at a human, who was bowing while presenting a plate of coins and scrolls.
    3. An ibis-headed [[Thoth]] puking out a long scroll with abstract writing (no actual words) into the hands of some humans.
    4. A baboon seated with a book on its thighs, holding a pen, and gazing at some humans while a feather appeared in the air. Identifying the baboon as another symbol of [[Thoth]] was easy, but naming the feather as the symbol of [[Maat|Thoth's wife Maat]] required a good Theology roll.
- **Nearby Well:** To the east of the pyramid, [[pcs/Vael Sunshadow|Vael]] discovered an interesting well. It was uncovered, about 5' wide, and its insides were covered with mirrors, such that the sun overhead produced blinding reflections. A [[Continual Light]] rock dropped into the well fell for several seconds, then stopped at the bottom, still making light, but reflections made details hard to see. There were no rungs in the well.

## Notes
- A rumor suggests that because this is the most well-known entrance, the areas immediately beneath it have been picked clean by other adventurers. It is suggested that the [[Well of Light]] might be a better entry point.
- Another rumor states that the Pyramid leads to the topmost of at least a dozen underground levels, which culminate in a huge cavern and lake at the bottom.
- Graffiti found inside the pyramid reads: "I told [[Robin]] not to touch the eyes. Now his picks are mine." This likely refers to the rumors about the dangerous gemstone eyes on statues of [[Thoth]].
