## Notes

- **Rumor:** A rumor describes a method for reaching "The Forum" that may apply to this location. It involves shining two lanterns from the left side of the river at night, then looking for a basket on the cliff face. A person named [[Stephania]] apparently pays well for basic supplies delivered this way.
