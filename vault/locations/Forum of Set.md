# Forum of Set

## Summary
A major area within the Halls of Arden Vul, dedicated to the [[Cult of Set]]. It includes a large statue of [[Set]], a marketplace, and is the site of the cult's "Mysteries."

## Notes
- **Rumor:** While the [[Cult of Set]] is known to enslave people on the [[Long Stair]], a rumor suggests that one is safe from enslavement if they make it to the Forum.
- **The Mysteries of Set:** A rumor describes a "First Mystery" which is considered "lame," and a "Second Mystery" which is impressive. A "Third Mystery" is alluded to, but asking the Deacons about it is met with threats of being sold into slavery.
- **Rumor:** Red guardsmen in the Forum have been overheard whispering about escaped slaves causing problems to the north.
- **Rumor:** A rumor describes a method for reaching "The Forum" that may apply to this location. It involves shining two lanterns from the left side of the river at night, then looking for a basket on the cliff face. A person named [[Stephania]] apparently pays well for basic supplies delivered this way.
