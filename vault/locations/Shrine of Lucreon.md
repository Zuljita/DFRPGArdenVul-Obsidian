# Shrine of Lucreon

## Summary
A shrine to the god [[Lucreon]] in [[Gosterwick]].

## Description
The shrine is a classic, three-chamber structure: an ante-cella for congregation, a cella for main rituals, and an unconnected postern with administrative offices and clergy apartments.

The main cultic object is a colossal granite statue of Lucreon, dressed as an Archontean factor associate, holding a massive bag of coins. An offering chest sits below the bag.

## The Mystery of Lucreon
The shrine is home to an impressive mystery: when a coin is dropped into the offering box, it magically appears in the air above the statue and falls into the god's money bag. The bag is emptied by the clerics each night.
