# Temple of Demma

While there are many temples to [[Demma]], this page primarily describes the temple located in [[Gosterwick]].

## The Temple in Gosterwick

### Overview
The Temple of Demma in [[Gosterwick]] is a modest but well-maintained structure that serves as a center for healing, wisdom, and rural devotion. It prioritizes practical, service-oriented aid to the local farmers and rural poor over the town's more mercenary-driven economy. Its faithful are primarily farmers, midwives, and homemakers.

### Staff
- **Chief Priest:** [[Vivian]], a stern but fair Thorcin cleric.
- **Assisting Clerics:** Four clerics who manage daily rituals and services.
- **Temple Guard:** Six dedicated warriors known as [[Harvest Guardians]], who wield flails.

### Services
The temple provides blessings for fields and expectant mothers, as well as limited magical services like healing, which are offered first to true believers and those in genuine need.

## The Priesthood of Demma

### Structure
The priesthood is hierarchical yet practical. Local temples are led by a Chief Priest who manages the temple and its obligations.
- **[[Seedkeepers]]:** A more esoteric branch of the priesthood, dedicated to guarding ancient agricultural knowledge and sacred rites.
- **[[Harvest Guardians]]:** The warrior arm of the faith, tasked with defending temples and enforcing Demma's will. They are trained in the use of the flail.

### Vestments
Clergy wear practical vestments in earthy tones (greens, yellows, browns) with a sleeveless outer robe of deep red or russet. The flail is a prominent symbol, used both as a weapon and as a ceremonial object.
