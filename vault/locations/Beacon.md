# Beacon

## Summary
The Beacon is a two-level base of operations that has been taken over by the party. Found notes strongly suggest that the Beacon is actually a "Vehicle," but its propulsion mechanism is currently unknown. It appears to require fuel, potentially a substance called [[Arcanum]].

It serves as a location for downtime activities and is accessed primarily via [[Rugs of Instant Access]].

## Technology & Functionality
Found notes found within the Beacon hint at its true nature and operation:
- **Vehicle Potential:** "Beacon = Vehicle - but how does it move?"
- **Fuel Requirement:** "Fuel is needed. [[Arcanum]] - for what?"
- **Operational Data:** A blackboard contains lists of stars and corresponding [[Rudishva glyphs]], as well as lists of letters and numbers, suggesting some form of navigation or control system.
- **Rudishva Rites Capability:** The Beacon currently lacks the ability to perform advanced [[Rudishva]] funeral rites such as "Full Recycling" and "Spacing."

## Access
- **Primary Access:** The party uses [[Rugs of Instant Access]] to travel between the Beacon and locations in town, such as the [[Arcane Practitioners' Club]].
- **Stairs:** There is a staircase leading out, but it is blocked by a thick stone cap covered in rubble. The bronze doors at the bottom of the stairs are password-protected.

## Layout & Features
The Beacon consists of two main areas across two levels:
- **Northern Area:** Features white marble floors and maintains a constant, comfortable temperature.
- **Southern Area:** Features gray granite floors and its temperature fluctuates with the outdoors. This area contains a lounge with comfortable furniture but can get very cold.

A stone door with a lock separates the two areas. The party does not possess the key and has relied on magic (`Lockmaster` spell) to open it.

### Keycard System
A system of oval keycards is used to operate doors:
- **Secret Closet:** A low-tech physical lock on a closet off the reading room can be opened by jamming any oval keycard into it.
- **Iris Doors:** The colored oval keycards (rust, brown, sky blue, pale green, orange) open the iris doors throughout the Beacon. The metallic keycards (copper, bronze, platinum) do not work for this.

## Amenities & Downtime
- **Downtime:** The Beacon can be used for various downtime activities, including:
    - Research using books found within the Beacon.
    - Language training with [[Akla-Chah]].
    - General base improvements.
- **Food & Drink:** A machine in [[Akla-Chah]]'s room dispenses "Arden Vul Cakes" and "Rudishva booze." It is unknown how long this will function.
- **Facilities:** There is no privy; party members must travel elsewhere (e.g., the [[Arcane Practitioners' Club]]) for facilities.
