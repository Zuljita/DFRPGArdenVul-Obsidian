# [[locations/Waterfall.md|Waterfall]]

## Summary
A prominent landmark of [[Arden Vul]], the [[locations/Waterfall.md|Waterfall]] is a powerful cascade of water, and its flow can be controlled from the nearby [[Dam (Arden Vul)|dam]]. A secret cavern behind the waterfall is rumored to be a former breeding ground for [[Set Animals]].

## Lore
- **Secret Cavern and Breeding Project**: An ancient rescript from the high priest of [[Set]] mentions a secret cavern near the waterfall. Here, the [[Temple of Set]] in [[Arden Vul]] reportedly succeeded in breeding a fearsome species of animals that 'shared all the attributes of Lord [[npcs/Set.md|Set]].' These creatures are thought to be a type of golem or magically augmented beast, referred to as [[Set Animals]].
