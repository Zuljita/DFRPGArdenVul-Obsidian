# Tower of Scrutiny

## Summary
A tower in [[Arden Vul]] that has served as a refuge and a point of intrigue throughout its history.

## Historical Note
A historical document, a letter from Archon [[Uriel Basileon]] to [[Kel Bormol]], Overseer of Thoth, reveals a past incident involving the tower. During a "[[Sortians|Sortian]] onslaught" that included "Sortian dragons," the Second Overseer of Thoth cowardly retreated and barricaded himself inside the Tower of Scrutiny, refusing entry to all.

Archon Basileon noted his intent to "smoke him out" and deliver him for punishment once the Sortian threat had passed. He also warned that his agents had seen a messenger from [[Hithra Paleologos]] gaining entrance to the tower, a development he considered ominous.
