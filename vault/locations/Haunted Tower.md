## Notes

### From the Journal of Ioannes
> I found the record. The tower at the base of the waterfall—built during the Adrienic Expedition, two and a half centuries past. An attempt by Archon Phocion IV to retake Arden Vul. It failed. Bloodily. The tower was left behind when the survivors fled.
> And now it is haunted. Or rather, “folklore,” according to one too-convenient source.
>
> I do not trust him. He either never saw the ghost himself, or pretended not to.
>
> I did. The spirit that emerged from that cellar did not wander aimlessly or mutter incoherently. It screamed—accused. “Settite murderers,” it said. That is not a random haunt. That is a wronged soul. It is bound, and it is angry.

> This is not folklore. This is unfinished business.

> Demma teaches that proper rest follows proper ritual. Perhaps there is something to uncover: a hidden corpse, a desecrated relic, an oath unfulfilled. I will return. Not yet. But soon. And I will put it to rest.
>
> Gods grant that it is no demon. If it is, I will not face it alone.
