# Temple of Mitra

## Summary
The Temple of Mitra in [[Gosterwick]] is a circular stone structure fronted by a portico with an impressive pediment.

## Description
The pediment shows [[Mitra]], dressed in shining mail, striding among worshippers, dispensing justice, and punishing the guilty.

The main cult object is a statue of the god dressed in an Archontean-style toga, holding the scales of justice in his left hand. Worshippers place offerings in the right-hand side of the scales.

The apartments and bureaucratic offices of the cult are cleverly set into the wall circling the main shrine.
