# Keko the Lame

## Summary
The head of the [[Drome]] in [[Narsileon]].

## Notes
- [[Wicktrimmer]] warns not to mess with him.
- Eradicating the [[Cult of Set]] in [[Arden Vul]] is believed to fall under his jurisdiction.
- [[npcs/Wicktrimmer.md|Wicktrimmer]] suggests that the [[locations/Gosterwick.md|Gosterwick]] branch of the [[factions/Drome.md|Drome]] may not communicate much with the [[locations/Narsileon.md|Narsileon]] branch.
