# Keko the Lame

## Summary
The head of the [[Drome]] in [[Narsileon]].

## Notes
- [[Wicktrimmer]] warns not to mess with him.
- Eradicating the [[Cult of Set]] in [[Arden Vul]] is believed to fall under his jurisdiction.
- Wicktrimmer suggests that the Gosterwick branch of the Drome may not communicate much with the Narsileon branch.
