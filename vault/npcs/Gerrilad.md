# [[npcs/Gerrilad.md|Gerrilad]]

## Summary
Eccentric half‑elven druid and torturer associated with cages, keys, and control over a portion of the levels near the [[locations/Library of Thoth.md|Library of Thoth]].

  - [[sessions/Session 16 - Random Scorpion Teleport to the Hall of Judgment.md|Session 16 - Random Scorpion Teleport to the Hall of Judgment]] — Vallium had [[npcs/Gerrilad.md|Gerrilad]]'s keys, and used them to unlock three cells and release [[npcs/Tresti.md|Tresti]] the half-elven mage, [[npcs/Jost.md|Jost]] the Thorcin barbarian, and [[npcs/Gwelf.md|Gwelf]] the apparently insane dwarf, who was running around his cage singing silly dwarven drinking so...
- [[sessions/Session 18 - Back Down the Well of Light.md|Session 18 - Back Down the Well of Light]] — Vael and Ioannes asked [[npcs/Stamelis.md|Stamelis]] a lot of questions, and he verified that [[locations/Library of Thoth.md|The Library of Thoth]] was just to the west of here, that th...
- [[sessions/Session 21 - The Library of Thoth.md|Session 21 - The Library of Thoth]] — Vallium went through his collection of keys, and one of them (which had been taken from [[npcs/Gerrilad.md|Gerrilad]]) unlocked the door.
  - [[sessions/Session 21 - The Library of Thoth.md|Session 21 - The Library of Thoth]] — When they got near the door he made it clear that he was an wizard, and that this was his library because [[npcs/Gerrilad.md|Gerrilad]], the owner of this level, gave it to him.
- [[sessions/Session 29 - The Tower of Scrutiny.md|Session 29 - The Tower of Scrutiny]] — The cavern contained a half-eaten dwarf corpse, which Ioannes recognized as [[npcs/Gwelf.md|Gwelf]], the dwarf they had freed from [[npcs/Gerrilad.md|Gerrilad]]'s prison, who had then run off.
- [[sessions/Session 32 - Fast Exploration.md|Session 32 - Fast Exploration]] — It was [[npcs/Dalton.md|Dalton]]'s Darlings, the entire group, including their friend [[npcs/Jost.md|Jost]] who they had rescued from [[npcs/Gerrilad.md|Gerrilad]]'s jail.

## Roles & Influence
- Local power on that level; holds keys and asserts authority over cells and passages.
- Indirect influence through keys taken from him that subsequently opened critical doors.

## Relationships
- Former prisoners: [[Tresti]], [[Jost]], [[Gwelf]] — freed using keys traced back to [[npcs/Gerrilad.md|Gerrilad]].
- Nearby spellcasters: claims around the [[Library of Thoth]] handed off to a resident wizard.
