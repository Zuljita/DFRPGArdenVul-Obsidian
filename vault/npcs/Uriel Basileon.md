# Uriel Basileon

## Summary
A historical archon of [[Arden Vul]]. He sent a message to [[Kel Bormol]], Overseer of [[Thoth]], regarding the cowardly [[Second Overseer]] and the suspicious activities of [[Hithra Paleologos]].

## Notes
- In a message to [[Kel Bormol]], Archon [[Uriel Basileon]] offers a reply to [[Kel Bormol]]'s pious inquiry. He notes that [[Second Overseer]], [[Kel Bormol]]'s assistant, has not dared show himself since his cowardly retreat before the [[Sortian]] onslaught and is cowering within the [[Tower of Scrutiny]], refusing entry to all.
- [[Uriel Basileon]] states his intention to "smoke him out of his lair" and deliver him for punishment should conditions improve and the [[Sortian]] dragons depart.
- He also warns [[Kel Bormol]] that his agents have noticed a messenger from [[Hithra Paleologos]] obtaining entrance to the [[Tower of Scrutiny]], which he believes cannot be good.
