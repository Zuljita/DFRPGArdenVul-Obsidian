# [[npcs/[[npcs/Weskenim.md|Weskenim]].md|[[npcs/Weskenim.md|Weskenim]]]]

## Summary
[[npcs/Weskenim.md|Weskenim]] is the ambitious and pragmatic ruler of the [[factions/United Goblins|United Goblins]], styling himself as their Grand King. From his court in [[locations/Goblintown|Goblintown]], he presides over a growing territory that includes the [[locations/Wet Caves|Wet Caves]] and the repurposed "Glory of [[npcs/Weskenim.md|Weskenim]]" (formerly the [[locations/Glory of Thoth|Glory of Thoth]]). While he projects authority through a network of sub-chiefs and sergeants, his rule is not universally accepted among all goblins, with some outlying groups openly disparaging him. He is known for his distinctive pink turban and his fondness for his pet cat, which can sometimes distract him from matters of state.

## History & Interactions
[[npcs/[[npcs/Weskenim.md|Weskenim]].md|[[npcs/Weskenim.md|Weskenim]]]]'s relationship with the [[factions/Right for Riches Company|Right for Riches Company]] began in earnest after they rescued his brother, [[npcs/Gribble|Gribble]], from the clutches of the [[factions/Cult of Set|Cult of Set]] ([[sessions/Session 23c - Set Jailbreak and Down to Goblintown]]).

A major point of contention for [[npcs/Weskenim.md|Weskenim]] was the occupation of what he considered goblin territory by [[npcs/Phlebotomas Plumthorn|Phlebotomas Plumthorn]]'s halfling gang. He enlisted the Right for Riches Company as "halfling exterminators" to deal with this problem. Upon the party's success in ousting [[npcs/Phlebotomas Plumthorn.md|Phlebotomas Plumthorn]] ([[sessions/Session 26 - The Scouring of the Shire]]), a grateful [[npcs/Weskenim.md|Weskenim]] rewarded them with a large perfect diamond, a suit of human-sized magical scale armor from an ancient goblin king, and free passage through goblin lands. Several party members were also awarded "[[npcs/Halfling Slayer.md|Halfling Slayer]]" patches, created by the goblin artist [[npcs/Temrin|Temrin]].

[[npcs/Weskenim.md|Weskenim]] is keenly interested in recovering the legendary **Scepter of the [[factions/Goblins.md|Goblins]]**, which he believes is key to unifying all goblin clans under his rule. He has promised the adventurers a further reward for its retrieval, though he dismisses the goblin mystic [[npcs/Gislu|Gislu]], who also seeks it, as a "fake."

He maintains a court with a major-domo named [[npcs/Palestrim|Palestrim]] and advisors like [[npcs/Skimmel|Skimmel]] and [[npcs/Reeflik|Reeflik]]. He has shown a degree of political cunning, deliberately delaying an audience with a group of mysterious wizards he suspected were hostile to the [[factions/Varumani|Varumani]], whom he wishes to avoid conflict with.

## Roles & Influence
- **Goblin Unifier:** Aspires to unite all goblin clans under his banner.
- **Territorial Expansion:** Actively works to expand goblin-controlled areas within [[locations/Arden Vul|Arden Vul]].
- **Key Quest Giver:** Has tasked the [[factions/Right for Riches Company|Right for Riches Company]] with recovering the [[items/Scepter of the Goblins|Scepter of the Goblins]].
 - **Faction Leader:** Commands a significant military force, including ogre guards and numerous goblin warriors led by officers like [[npcs/Killick.md|Killik]] and [[npcs/Bottleneck.md|Bottleneck]].

## Relationships
- **[[npcs/Gribble|Gribble]]:** His brother. [[npcs/Gribble.md|Gribble]]'s rescue from a [[factions/Cult of Set|Set]] prison was the catalyst for [[npcs/Weskenim.md|Weskenim]]'s alliance with the party.
- **[[npcs/Phlebotomas Plumthorn|Phlebotomas Plumthorn]]:** A major rival whose expulsion from the Halls was a key victory for [[npcs/Weskenim.md|Weskenim]], secured with the party's help.
- **[[factions/Right for Riches Company|Right for Riches Company]]:** A key, if sometimes transactional, ally. He has rewarded them for their services and relies on them for important tasks.
- **[[npcs/Palestrim|Palestrim]]:** His major-domo, responsible for managing the royal court.
- **[[npcs/Bottleneck|Bottleneck]]:** His Master Sergeant in [[locations/Upper Goblintown|Upper Goblintown]].
- **[[npcs/Killick.md|Killik]]:** The "Big Boss" of the [[locations/Wet Caves.md|Wet Caves]], who reports directly to [[npcs/Weskenim.md|Weskenim]].
- **[[npcs/Sir Sorrow|Sir Sorrow]]:** A [[factions/Sun-Scarred Knights|Sun-Scarred Knight]] who was a guest in his court for a time.
- **[[npcs/Gislu|Gislu]]:** A rival for power who claims to be a mystic; [[npcs/Weskenim.md|Weskenim]] considers him a fraud.

## Notes
- Some goblins, particularly a splinter group living with baboons, hold a negative view of his rule, stating "[[npcs/[[npcs/Weskenim.md|Weskenim]].md|[[npcs/Weskenim.md|Weskenim]]]] sucked."
- He has a harem, from which he was emerging when the party arrived to report on their victory over the halflings.
- The goblin artist [[Temrin]] has painted portraits of both [[npcs/Weskenim.md|Weskenim]] and [[Gribble]].
