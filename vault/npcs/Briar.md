# Briar

## History
- [[sessions/Session 26 - The Scouring of the Shire.md|Session 26 - The Scouring of the Shire]] — Craastonistorex appeared to consider eating her for such a paltry gift, but magnanimously let it slide, as Briar the wyvern picked up the potion in his claws.

## Notes
Briar is a wyvern, and the pet of Craastonistorex.
