## History
- [[sessions/Session 26 - The Scouring of the Shire.md|Session 26 - The Scouring of the Shire]] — [[npcs/Craastonistorex.md|Craastonistorex]] appeared to consider eating her for such a paltry gift, but magnanimously let it slide, as [[npcs/Briar.md|Briar]] the wyvern picked up the potion in his claws.

## Notes
[[npcs/Briar.md|Briar]] is a wyvern, and the pet of [[npcs/Craastonistorex.md|Craastonistorex]].
