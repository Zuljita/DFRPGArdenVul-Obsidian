- [[sessions/Session 1 - First Visit to the Ruins of Arden Vul.md|Session 1 - First Visit to the Ruins of Arden Vul]] — He saw a room with a large statue of an 8' tall ibis head in the center, and three relatively recent corpses on the floor, two humans in scale armor with shortswords and one halfling in leather armor that Vael's magery detected as magical.
  - [[sessions/Session 1 - First Visit to the Ruins of Arden Vul.md|Session 1 - First Visit to the Ruins of Arden Vul]] — In addition to the ibis head statue and the corpses, the top floor also featured a couple of wooden stairways down, but only the first few feet of each stairway was visible before things got dark with a suspiciously sharp cutoff.

  - [[sessions/Session 3 - Dragons and Baboons and Beastmen, Oh My!.md|Session 3 - Dragons and Baboons and Beastmen, Oh My!]] — Michael wiped the soot off the niche plug and found both an image of ibis-headed Thoth with his left arm forward and his right arm down, and a sigil of a tower with light shining out of one window.

- [[sessions/Session 6 - Good Ghost, Bad Ghost.md|Session 6 - Good Ghost, Bad Ghost]] — Ashe thought the stars were the constellation of the Ibis, but the others were less sure.

- [[sessions/Session 23a - Gelatinous Cube and Slime Kraken.md|Session 23a - Gelatinous Cube and Slime Kraken]] — There was some anti-Thoth graffiti on the walls, and a picture of a crocodile eating an ibis, indicating that the vandalism was probably the work of Settites.
- [[sessions/Session 24b - The Set Cult Strikes Back, Larel's Stuff, and the Hall of Shrines.md|Session 24b - The Set Cult Strikes Back, Larel's Stuff, and the Shrines.md|Hall of Shrines]]]] — Dundee, Thorcin barbarian (Adam) Uvash Edzuson, Dwarven cleric of Zodarrim (Cosmo) Significant NPCs: Many Set guards Several Set acolytes Several Set sergeants [[factions/Cult of Set.md|Some Set Guild of Service fighters]]

  - [[sessions/Session 29 - The Tower of Scrutiny.md|Session 29 - The Tower of Scrutiny]] — The giant ibis-headed Thoth statue was wearing a pink turban, sort of resembling the one King Weskenim wore.
