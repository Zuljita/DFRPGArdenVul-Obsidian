  - [[sessions/Session 1 - First Visit to the Ruins of Arden Vul.md|Session 1 - First Visit to the Ruins of Arden Vul]] — In addition to the ibis head statue and the corpses, the top floor also featured a couple of wooden stairways down, but only the first few feet of each stairway was visible before things got dark with a suspiciously sharp cutoff.

  - [[sessions/Session 2 - Halfling Rent-Seekers.md|Session 2 - Halfling Rent-Seekers]] — The walls were lined with sixteen pictures of ibis heads all looking at the same point in the center of the floor, but there was nothing interesting at that point.
- [[sessions/Session 3 - Dragons and Baboons and Beastmen, Oh My!.md|Session 3 - Dragons and Baboons and Beastmen, Oh My!]] — Ioannes went down the stairs alone a bit, and saw that these stairs were much less worn than the other ones, that there were pictures of various animals (hippo, crocodile, ibis, baboon, giraffe) on the front of the stairs, and that there...
  - [[sessions/Session 3 - Dragons and Baboons and Beastmen, Oh My!.md|Session 3 - Dragons and Baboons and Beastmen, Oh My!]] — Michael wiped the soot off the niche plug and found both an image of ibis-headed [[npcs/Thoth.md|Thoth]] with his left arm forward and his right arm down, and a sigil of a tower with light shining out of one window.

  - [[sessions/Session 19 - The Pool of Donkey Ears.md|Session 19 - The Pool of Donkey Ears]] — Another position caused a secret door on the east wall to open, and an angry ibis-headed construct of [[npcs/Thoth.md|Thoth]] came out to attack.

- [[sessions/Session 23a - Gelatinous Cube and Slime Kraken.md|Session 23a - Gelatinous Cube and Slime Kraken]] — There was some anti-[[npcs/Thoth.md|Thoth]] graffiti on the walls, and a picture of a crocodile eating an ibis, indicating that the vandalism was probably the work of [[factions/Cult of [[npcs/Set.md|Set]].md|Cult of [[npcs/Set.md|Set]]]].

  - [[sessions/Session 29 - The Tower of Scrutiny.md|Session 29 - The Tower of Scrutiny]] — The giant ibis-headed [[npcs/Thoth.md|Thoth]] statue was wearing a pink turban, sort of resembling the one [[npcs/[[npcs/Weskenim.md|Weskenim]].md|[[npcs/Weskenim.md|Weskenim]]]] wore.
- [[sessions/Session 31 - I Want to Believe.md|Session 31 - I Want to Believe]] — Once again they searched for secret doors, and this time Vael spotted an ibis fresco on the north wall that looked suspicious, with a slot in its beak.
