# Kel Bormol

## Summary
[[Kel Bormol]] is a historical Overseer of [[Thoth]]. He received a message from [[Archon Uriel Basileon]] concerning the cowardly [[Second Overseer]], his assistant, who had retreated before a [[Sortian]] onslaught and was cowering in the [[Tower of Scrutiny]].

## Notes
- [[Archon Uriel Basileon]] intends to "smoke out" the [[Second Overseer]] and deliver him to [[Kel Bormol]] for punishment once conditions improve.
