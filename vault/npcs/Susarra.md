## Notes

## Death & Investigation
Susarra was murdered in her room at the [[Yellow Cloak Inn]] in [[Gosterwick]]. Her headless corpse was discovered by [[Vallium Halcyon]] after he was discretely summoned by the innkeeper, [[Margot the Red]]. The initial investigation was handled by the [[Thesmothete]]'s guards, who noted that it took the killer several blows with a large, sharp axe to sever her head. Her head, axe, ring, mail, and backpack were all taken from the scene.

The murder is believed to be retaliation from the [[Cult of Set]], as Susarra had recently participated in a violent raid against them in the ruins of [[Arden Vul]]. This was confirmed when [[Coinbase]], a member of the [[Grudge Brigade]], sold the party a letter he had received. The letter offered a bounty of $2,500 each for the capture or kill of [[Vael]], [[Ioannes]], [[Michael]], [[Uvash]], [[Vallium Halcyon]], and Susarra. The instructions were to bring the remains to the [[Duty Deacon]] at the [[Forum of Set|Forum in Arden Vul]], who would then alert the [[Pontifex]].

The [[Drome]] was officially informed of the murder, and [[Audun Yellow-Eyes]], a logothete of the House of Sight, provided the party with a sample of Susarra's blood for magical tracking. Using a *Seeker* spell, [[Vael]] was able to determine that Susarra's head was approximately 10 miles north of [[Gosterwick]], in a well-decorated room, stored inside a backpack.
