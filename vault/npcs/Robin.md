# [[npcs/Robin.md|Robin]]

## Summary
An individual, presumably a thief or adventurer, mentioned in a piece of graffiti.

## Notes
- Graffiti found in the [[Pyramid of Thoth]] reads: "I told [[npcs/Robin.md|Robin]] not to touch the eyes. Now his picks are mine."
- This suggests [[npcs/Robin.md|Robin]] attempted to steal the gemstone eyes from a statue of [[Thoth]] and was likely killed by the animated statue.
