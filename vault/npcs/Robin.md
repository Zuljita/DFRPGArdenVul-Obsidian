# Robin

## Summary
An individual, presumably a thief or adventurer, mentioned in a piece of graffiti.

## Notes
- Graffiti found in the [[Pyramid of Thoth]] reads: "I told Robin not to touch the eyes. Now his picks are mine."
- This suggests Robin attempted to steal the gemstone eyes from a statue of [[Thoth]] and was likely killed by the animated statue.
