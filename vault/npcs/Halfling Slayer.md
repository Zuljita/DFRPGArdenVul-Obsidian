# Halfling Slayer

## Appears In
- [[sessions/Session 32 - Fast Exploration.md|Session 32 - Fast Exploration]]

## History
- [[sessions/Session 32 - Fast Exploration.md|Session 32 - Fast Exploration]] — One looked at him and said "Halfling Slayer, you may pass." Vael went back for the others, and they used a rope to climb up to the hole, then emerged into the Goblin Great Hall.
  - [[sessions/Session 32 - Fast Exploration.md|Session 32 - Fast Exploration]] — He asked what Temrin painted, and Temrin said he mostly did portraits, but pointed at Vallium's Halfling Slayer patch and said that he'd made those for the King.
