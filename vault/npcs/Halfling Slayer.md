## History
- [[sessions/Session 32 - Fast Exploration.md|Session 32 - Fast Exploration]] — One looked at him and said "[[npcs/Halfling Slayer.md|Halfling Slayer]], you may pass." Vael went back for the others, and they used a rope to climb up to the hole, then emerged into the [[locations/Goblin [[locations/Great Hall.md|Great Hall]].md|Goblin [[locations/Great Hall.md|Great Hall]]]].
  - [[sessions/Session 32 - Fast Exploration.md|Session 32 - Fast Exploration]] — He asked what [[npcs/Temrin.md|Temrin]] painted, and [[npcs/Temrin.md|Temrin]] said he mostly did portraits, but pointed at Vallium's [[npcs/Halfling Slayer.md|Halfling Slayer]] patch and said that he'd made those for the King.
