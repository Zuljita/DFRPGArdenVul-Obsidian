# Ethereum “Coinbase” Thuringwador

## Summary
Ethereum “Coinbase” Thuringwador is an elven illusionist and the leader of the [[factions/Grudge Brigade|Grudge Brigade]] mercenary company. Often described by the party as an "annoying elf," Coinbase is a relentless hustler and fixer, constantly trying to upsell clients on his "illusion-based tactical assistance system" or brokering deals. Despite his sometimes-abrasive salesmanship, he is a competent illusionist and a pragmatic, if self-serving, ally who has joined the [[factions/Right for Riches Company|Right for Riches Company]] on several delves.

## History & Interactions
Coinbase has been a recurring hired spellcaster for the [[factions/Right for Riches Company|Right for Riches Company]], stepping in when the party's own mages are unavailable. His services, however, always come with a sales pitch.

His most significant non-combat interaction involved the [[factions/Cult of Set|Cult of Set]]. He received an anonymous contract offering a substantial reward for the death of the party members and [[npcs/Susarra|Susarra]]. Rather than acting on it, Coinbase saw a better business opportunity and sold the information to [[pcs/Vael Sunshadow|Vael]], providing the party with crucial intelligence about the threat against them ([[sessions/Session 23c - Set Jailbreak and Down to Goblintown]]).

During the harrowing delve into the [[locations/Tower of Scrutiny|Tower of Scrutiny]], it was Coinbase who wisely called for a tactical retreat when the party was overwhelmed by wraiths, a decision that likely saved them from a total party kill ([[sessions/Session 29 - The Tower of Scrutiny]]). He has also proven adept at creative problem-solving, such as using his "probably unbreakable" orichalcum shield as a crowbar to break open a tomb plug ([[sessions/Session 3 - Dragons and Baboons and Beastmen, Oh My!]]).

## Roles & Influence
- **Leader of the [[factions/Grudge Brigade|Grudge Brigade]]:** As the head of the mercenary company, he manages contracts and deploys his subordinates.
- **Mercenary Illusionist:** Provides magical support for hire, specializing in illusion and utility spells like [[spells/Levitation|Levitation]] and [[spells/Phantom|Phantom]].
- **Information Broker:** His position as a mercenary leader gives him access to the undercurrents of Gosterwick's adventurer economy, making him a valuable, if costly, source of information.

## Abilities

- **Illusion Magic:** He frequently uses a **[[spells/Phantom|Phantom]]** spell to create semi-real illusions that can assist in combat.
- **Utility Spells:** He is a frequent user of **[[spells/Levitation|Levitation]]** for transport and has also used **Lighten Burden**.
- **Combat:** While primarily a mage, he is not shy about entering melee, using his expensive **orichalcum shield** for both defense and offense (shield-bashing). He has been noted as being a particularly fast runner.
- **Negotiation:** He is a shrewd negotiator, always looking to maximize his profit, as seen in his dealings with the halfling toll collectors.

## Relationships
- **[[factions/Right for Riches Company|Right for Riches Company]]:** His primary clients. The relationship is purely business, though his timely advice has proven life-saving.
- **[[factions/Cult of Set|Cult of Set]]:** He was contracted by them to assassinate the party, but he betrayed the contract for a better offer from the party themselves.
