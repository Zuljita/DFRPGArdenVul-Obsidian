# Merenuithiel Armaris

## Summary
Merenuithiel "Lacrymosa" Armaris is a skilled but notoriously aggressive Elven mercenary archer, frequently hired by the [[factions/Right for Riches Company|Right for Riches Company]] from the [[factions/Grudge Brigade|Grudge Brigade]]. She serves as recurring ranged support and is known for her deadly efficiency in combat and a relentless desire to confront and kill halflings.

## Personality and Reputation
Lacrymosa has earned a reputation for being "bloodthirsty." She is single-minded in her goals, tirelessly advocating for aggressive solutions and showing no hesitation in combat. This was most evident in her brutal efficiency during the assault on [[npcs/Phlebotomas Plumthorn|Plumthorn's]] gang, where she killed stunned, fleeing, or surrendering enemies without pause.

Despite her aggression, she can be a team player, participating in planning and negotiations. She has also shown a moment of humility, apologizing after her recklessness led to her being incapacitated during a fight with stirges.

Her defining character trait is a deep-seated animosity towards the extortionist halflings of [[npcs/Phlebotomas Plumthorn|Phlebotomas Plumthorn]], a topic she raises almost every time she is hired.

## Notable Actions
Lacrymosa has been involved in numerous operations with the party, often turning the tide of difficult fights.

- **First Hiring (Session 4):** First hired from the [[factions/Grudge Brigade|Grudge Brigade]], she aided the party in exploring a section of the [[locations/Pyramid of Thoth|Pyramid of Thoth]], fighting off demons and flying jellyfish-like creatures. She was already advocating for fighting the halflings.
- **Negotiations at the Inn (Session 8b & 9):** She assisted the party in negotiating the sale of three gold shabti statues to merchant factors at the [[locations/Sign of the Broken Head|Sign of the Broken Head]].
- **The Great Cavern (Session 15):** During a return to the [[locations/Great Cavern|Great Cavern]], she accidentally shot [[pcs/Vallium|Vallium]] in the back. Later, she was swarmed by stirges and knocked unconscious after acting alone, for which she apologized. She also served as a makeshift boat captain for the party.
- **Well of Light (Session 22):** Hired again, she immediately asked if it was "time to kill the halflings yet." She helped clear a room of ghouls and fought animated ibis statues, but did not take part in the spiritual "Litany of Light" ritual.
- **The Halfling Takedown (Session 26):** Lacrymosa was instrumental in the successful ambush of [[npcs/Phlebotomas Plumthorn|Plumthorn's]] halfling gang. Using potions and a Concussion spell, she neutralized and killed numerous halflings, including the leader [[npcs/Blandveg|Blandveg]] and a fleeing [[npcs/Roskelly Winterleaf|Roskelly Winterleaf]]. Her brutal efficiency was a key factor in the encounter.
- **Official Recognition (Session 32):** For her role in the "Great Reconquest of [[locations/Upper Goblintown|Upper Goblintown]]," she was officially recognized by [[npcs/Weskenim|King Weskenim]] and awarded a patch naming her a "**Halfling Slayer**."
