## Notes

- **Rumor:** A rumor claimed that the priests of [[Mitra]] were looking for [[npcs/Lillian.md|Lillian]], and that she went missing near a [[Huge Overgrown Thicket]] near the cliff of [[Arden Vul]]. A shepherd claimed to have seen her taken by [[Walking Pigs]] up into the ruins. A big reward for her return was posted in [[Newmarket]].

## Relationships
- [[Temple of Mitra]] ([[locations/Newmarket.md|Newmarket]]/[[locations/Gosterwick.md|Gosterwick]]): home church; issued reward and provided support.
- PCs: repeated attempts and eventual jailbreak involvement.
