# Craastonistorex

## Summary

Craastonistorex is a huge green dragon who lairs in the ruins of [[Arden Vul]] and considers himself the apex predator of the area. He has at least one pet wyvern named [[Briar]].

He has made a deal with the party to act as "Wardens of the Dam" in exchange for tribute.

## Disposition

Hostile and extremely dangerous, but willing to negotiate if it serves his interests.

## Notes

- An account from approximately 50 years ago details an encounter between the dragon and a party of 12 of [[Lord Burdock]]'s men-at-arms, where he killed 10 of them. This event led Lord Burdock to forbid exploration of the ruins.
- **Rumor:** The dragon rules the surface ruins and extorts a toll on those he catches exiting the Halls.
- **Rumor:** He is rumored to be the son of a more ancient wyrm that lives at the bottom of the [[Great Chasm]].

## Relationships
- [[Briar]]: pet wyvern serving as a scout and enforcer.
- PCs (“Wardens of the Dam”): negotiated arrangement trading tribute for limited non‑interference.
