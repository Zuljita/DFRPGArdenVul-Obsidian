# [[npcs/Phlebotomas [[npcs/Phlebotomas Plumthorn.md|Phlebotomas Plumthorn]].md|Phlebotomas [[npcs/Phlebotomas Plumthorn.md|Phlebotomas Plumthorn]]]]

## Summary
[[npcs/Phlebotomas [[npcs/Phlebotomas Plumthorn.md|Phlebotomas Plumthorn]].md|Phlebotomas [[npcs/Phlebotomas Plumthorn.md|Phlebotomas Plumthorn]]]] was the halfling mob boss who ran an extortion racket near the pyramid landings under [[locations/Arden Vul|Arden Vul]]. For a long time, he and his gang of thugs controlled access to the [[locations/Halls of Thoth|Halls of Thoth]], demanding payment from all who passed. His operation was ultimately dismantled by the [[factions/Right for Riches Company|Right for Riches Company]] in a decisive assault.

## Criminal Enterprise
[[npcs/Phlebotomas Plumthorn.md|Phlebotomas Plumthorn]]'s gang controlled the territory beneath the [[locations/Pyramid of Thoth|Pyramid of Thoth]]. His business model involved:
- **"Adventuring Licenses":** Forcing adventurers to purchase a license for 25 gp to enter the area.
- **Tithing:** Demanding a 10% tithe on all treasure recovered by licensed parties.
- **Protection Racket:** Extending his influence beyond the ruins, running a protection racket for merchants as far away as [[locations/Newmarket|Newmarket]].
- **Armed Enforcement:** His gang was known to be well-armed, reportedly using magic wands and poison.

## Relationships
- **[[npcs/Roskelly Winterleaf|Roskelly Winterleaf]]:** [[npcs/Phlebotomas Plumthorn.md|Phlebotomas Plumthorn]]'s primary lieutenant, responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of the toll collection. He was killed by [[npcs/Lacrymosa|Lacrymosa]] while attempting to flee during the party's final assault.
- **[[npcs/Blandveg|Blandveg]]:** An Archontean mage, alchemist, and poisoner who worked with the halflings. He was also killed by [[npcs/Lacrymosa|Lacrymosa]].
- **[[npcs/Weskenim|King Weskenim]]:** A significant rival. [[npcs/Phlebotomas Plumthorn.md|Phlebotomas Plumthorn]]'s gang was squatting on territory that [[npcs/Weskenim.md|Weskenim]] considered a rightful goblin entrance to the surface. The goblin king encouraged the party to act as "halfling exterminators."
- **[[factions/Right for Riches Company|Right for Riches Company]]:** [[npcs/Phlebotomas Plumthorn.md|Phlebotomas Plumthorn]]'s relationship with the party was fraught with tension from their first meeting. The constant tolls and harassment were a recurring point of frustration, eventually leading to his downfall.

## The Downfall
After numerous sessions of debate and planning, the [[factions/Right for Riches Company|Right for Riches Company]] finally moved against [[npcs/Phlebotomas Plumthorn.md|Phlebotomas Plumthorn]] in **Session 26**.
- **The Plan:** Aided by the mercenary [[npcs/Lacrymosa|Lacrymosa]], the party used a combination of flight and invisibility spells to bypass [[npcs/Phlebotomas Plumthorn.md|Phlebotomas Plumthorn]]'s guards and strike directly at the leadership.
- **The Assault:** The ambush was a resounding success. [[npcs/Merenuithiel Lacrymosa [[npcs/Merenuithiel Lacrymosa Armaris.md|Merenuithiel Lacrymosa Armaris]].md|Merenuithiel Lacrymosa [[npcs/Merenuithiel Lacrymosa Armaris.md|Merenuithiel Lacrymosa Armaris]]]] killed [[npcs/Blandveg|Blandveg]] almost immediately. [[npcs/Phlebotomas Plumthorn.md|Phlebotomas Plumthorn]] was quickly wounded and, after a successful intimidation by [[pcs/Vael Sunshadow|Vael]], was forced to surrender.
- **The Aftermath:** [[npcs/Phlebotomas Plumthorn.md|Phlebotomas Plumthorn]] was stripped of his possessions, including his keys, which were later copied and given to the goblins. He and his surviving followers were exiled from [[locations/Arden Vul|Arden Vul]] and instructed to return to [[locations/Newmarket|Newmarket]] under threat of death. His former territory was then ceded to [[npcs/Weskenim|King Weskenim]]'s goblins.
