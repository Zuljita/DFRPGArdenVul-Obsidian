# Akla-Chah

## Summary
[[Akla-Chah]] is a [[Rudishva]] hologram/AI therapist residing in the [[Beacon]]. She provides questioning, training, and occasional language practice; speaks [[Archontean]] with a curious inflection. She is knowledgeable about [[Rudishva]] customs, including their funeral rites.

## Knowledge & Abilities
- **Rudishva Funeral Rites:** Akla-Chah can describe various [[Rudishva]] funeral traditions:
    - **Full Recycling:** Considered the best method, but the [[Beacon]] currently lacks the ability to perform it.
    - **Spacing:** The second-best method, also currently impractical at the [[Beacon]].
    - **Cremation:** The third-best option, feasible if a suitably hot fire can be built outside the [[Beacon]].
- **Language Training:** Can provide language training to the party as a downtime activity.
- **Therapeutic Abilities:** Good at asking questions and functions as a therapist or psychologist.
