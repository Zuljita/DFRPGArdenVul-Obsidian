# Ptarmis

## Summary
Mysterious Thoth‑aligned wizard tied to the fungal caverns near the [[Great Cavern]]. Accounts conflict between a living recluse met by the party and a historical Thothian priest of the same name credited with opening the cavern and cultivating giant mushrooms.

## Appears In
- [[sessions/Session 5 - Parleys and The Great Cavern.md|Session 5 - Parleys and The Great Cavern]]
- [[sessions/Session 6 - Good Ghost, Bad Ghost.md|Session 6 - Good Ghost, Bad Ghost]]
- [[sessions/Session 30 - The Tomb of Theskalon.md|Session 30 - The Tomb of Theskalon]]

## Roles & Influence
- Claimed “master of the cavern”; rumored to direct or bargain with the [[Fungal Foresters]].
- Historical priest of [[Thoth]] associated with discovery and control of the [[Great Cavern]].

## Relationships
- [[Fungal Foresters]]: alleged influence or control; at minimum long familiarity.
- Thothian orders: strong association in inscriptions and lore; ambiguous across eras.

## History
- [[sessions/Session 5 - Parleys and The Great Cavern.md|Session 5 - Parleys and The Great Cavern]] — # DFRPG Arden Vul Session 5: Parleys and [[locations/Great Cavern.md|The Great Cavern]] Date: Demmasday, 11th of Lucrios, 2993 AEP Weather: Cool, overcast, rainy Player Char...
  - [[sessions/Session 5 - Parleys and The Great Cavern.md|Session 5 - Parleys and The Great Cavern]] — The man identified himself as Ptarmis, the master of the cavern.
- [[sessions/Session 6 - Good Ghost, Bad Ghost.md|Session 6 - Good Ghost, Bad Ghost]] — Vallium again tried finding rumors about Plumthorn's halfling gang in various drinking establishments, and instead heard something about Ptarmis, a wizard who lived in the fungal caverns.
- [[sessions/Session 25 - Looking for the Back Door to the Forum of Set.md|Session 25 - Looking for the Back Door to the Forum of Set]] — The lead forester talked about how cool Ptarmis was and how much he liked the living wheelbarrow and asked if they were friends of Ptarmis.
  - [[sessions/Session 25 - Looking for the Back Door to the Forum of Set.md|Session 25 - Looking for the Back Door to the Forum of Set]] — Vael indicated that they were also friends of Ptarmis and asked if the foresters had a source of cloud cap mushrooms.
- [[sessions/Session 30 - The Tomb of Theskalon.md|Session 30 - The Tomb of Theskalon]] — There was a Mithric inscription on the sarcophagus: Here rests Ptarmis loyal servant of Thoth seeker of hidden ways who destroyed the loathsome ones raised his children from spores and opened this cavern Those who disturb his sleep Will ...
  - [[sessions/Session 30 - The Tomb of Theskalon.md|Session 30 - The Tomb of Theskalon]] — This was a bit confusing, since they'd met a man named Ptarmis, on the throne a bit to the east, who was very much alive.

## Notes

- A found note claims that Ptarmis can control the [[Fungal Foresters]].
- Historical research identifies a figure named Ptarmis as a famous [[Thoth|Thothian]] priest from the early days of [[Arden Vul]].
- This historical Ptarmis is credited with discovering the [[Great Cavern]] and bringing it under Archontean control.
- He was also known for breeding giant mushrooms, and one source claims he left his family and church to live with them like a "weird Druid."
- This historical context is confusing, as the party has met a man named Ptarmis who is currently alive.
- A sarcophagus has been found with an inscription for a "Ptarmis loyal servant of Thoth."
- **Rumor:** A rumor states that the great Thothian wizard Ptarmis built a secret tomb for himself amid a huge forest of colossal mushrooms on the second level from the surface. The explorers who found the cavern were driven back by [[Sheep-headed Critters]].

## Hook
A name shared across centuries: hermit wizard or the echo of a Thothian master?
