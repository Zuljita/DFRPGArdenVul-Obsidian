# Anaximander

## Summary
Anaximander is an ancient sage and cleric of [[Mitra]]. He was discovered by the party in a seemingly insane state, having been trapped in a chair for a very long time. After being rescued and brought to [[Gosterwick]], he was healed of his insanity and began dictating historical events from 250 years ago to other clerics.
