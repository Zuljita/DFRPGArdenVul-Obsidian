# [[npcs/Phantom.md|Phantom]]

## Appears In
- [[sessions/Session 7 - Why Did It Have to Be Plants.md|Session 7 - Why Did It Have to Be Plants?]]

## History
- [[sessions/Session 7 - Why Did It Have to Be Plants.md|Session 7 - Why Did It Have to Be Plants?]] — Vallium and Michael swatted a couple down, while [[npcs/Coinbase.md|Coinbase]] summoned a semi-illusionary [[npcs/Phantom.md|Phantom]].
  - [[sessions/Session 7 - Why Did It Have to Be Plants.md|Session 7 - Why Did It Have to Be Plants?]] — Michael chopped the tendril holding [[npcs/Coinbase.md|Coinbase]], freeing the elf to cast a [[npcs/Phantom.md|Phantom]], which fooled the not-very-smart plant that it was real, and started ripping off tendrils.
