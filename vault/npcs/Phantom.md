## History
- [[sessions/Session 7 - Why Did It Have to Be Plants.md|Session 7 - Why Did It Have to Be Plants?]] — Vallium and Michael swatted a couple down, while Coinbase summoned a semi-illusionary Phantom.
  - [[sessions/Session 7 - Why Did It Have to Be Plants.md|Session 7 - Why Did It Have to Be Plants?]] — Michael chopped the tendril holding Coinbase, freeing the elf to cast a Phantom, which fooled the not-very-smart plant that it was real, and started ripping off tendrils.
