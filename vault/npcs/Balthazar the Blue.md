# Balthazar the Blue

## Summary
A wizard who was the leader of the [[Lost and Found]] adventuring party.

## History
He was apparently big on self-promotion, and some of his party's exploits were likely made up. After a successful adventuring career, he got married, had a child, and retired at his wife's request. He now lives in [[Narsileon]], where he raises his kids and makes potions.

## Notes
- He is a long-time friend of [[Wicktrimmer]], his former party member.
- [[npcs/Wicktrimmer.md|Wicktrimmer]] believes that Balthazar does not think [[Larel]] was a real person, and is eager to prove him wrong.
