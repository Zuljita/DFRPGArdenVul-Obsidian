## Appears In
- [[sessions/Session 6 - Good Ghost, Bad Ghost.md|Session 6 - Good Ghost, Bad Ghost]]

## History
- [[sessions/Session 6 - Good Ghost, Bad Ghost.md|Session 6 - Good Ghost, Bad Ghost]] — Ioannes suggested searching all the stalls, and after a long search the group found a couple of potions (one of them looking magical, one not; Ashe thought that was was poison), some old silver coins, a fancy ceremonial headdress, a coup...
- [[sessions/Session 32 - Fast Exploration.md|Session 32 - Fast Exploration]] — He saw some Aqua Vitae, and some big red mushrooms that might be fatal Red Veil or might be valuable Red Lotus, but since he wasn't sure he recommended not touching them.
