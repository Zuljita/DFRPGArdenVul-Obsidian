# Wicktrimmer

## Summary
Wicktrimmer is a wealthy and influential goblin who runs the [[Rarities Factor]] in [[Gosterwick]]. He is a retired adventurer, a savvy businessman, and an avid collector of magical and historical artifacts. He is considered one of the most powerful people in Gosterwick.

## Background
Wicktrimmer was formerly a member of an adventuring party called [[Lost and Found]], which was led by the wizard [[Balthazar the Blue]] and the paladin [[Grimley]]. His party explored [[Arden Vul]] extensively, making it as far as the [[Obsidian Gates]] before the party disbanded when Balthazar retired.

Twelve years ago, Wicktrimmer founded the [[Rarities Factor]] in [[Gosterwick]], later expanding to [[Newmarket]] and [[Narsileon]].

## Business & Capabilities
As the head of the [[Rarities Factor]], Wicktrimmer offers banking, letters of credit, and shipping via mule caravan at cheaper rates than his competitors. He also has a number of other capabilities:
- **Intelligence:** He seems to know everything that happens in Gosterwick and has magical means of detecting any new magic items that enter the town.
- **Resources:** He employs his own wizard, [[Ingimund of Arcturus]], for identifying magical items.
- **Logistics:** He can arrange for concierge shopping in [[Narsileon]] and can send messages there in less than a day.
- **Connections:** He is apparently friends with other important local figures, such as the [[Green Lady]] and [[Lady Alexia Basileon]].

## Notable Interactions
- **The Larel Artifacts:** Wicktrimmer's interest in collecting led him to negotiate a major deal with the Right for Riches Company for [[Larel's Pin]] and [[Larel's Dagger]]. His motivation was partly personal, as he wanted to prove the existence of the legendary Larel to his old friend [[Balthazar the Blue]].
- **Enemies of the Party:** He provided intelligence on the murder of [[Susarra]], attributing it to the [[Cult of Set]]. He also advised the party to be cautious of local politics involving [[Lady Alexia Basileon]], her half-brother [[Lord Iskander Burdock]], and the [[Drome]] in Narsileon, led by [[Keko the Lame]].
- **Teleportation:** He is extremely interested in acquiring a reliable method of long-range (400-mile) teleportation to improve his business logistics.
 
## Relationships
- [[Lady Alexia Basileon]]: mutual respect; aligned on town order and trade vitality.
- [[Right for Riches Company]]: frequent counterparties for artifact brokerage and financing.
- [[Balthazar the Blue]] and [[Lost and Found]]: former adventuring ties; continuing personal motivations.
- [[Drome]] of [[Narsileon]] and the [[Rarities Factor]] network: competitive intelligence and logistics sphere.
