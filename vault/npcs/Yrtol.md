# Yrtol

## Summary
A restless ghost haunting the [[Haunted Tower]] at the base of the [[Waterfall]]. Encountered by the party during early delves, it is known for its angry, territorial behavior and screams accusations of "Settite murderers." [[Ioannes]] interprets it as a "wronged soul" with "unfinished business," bound to the tower.

## Notes
