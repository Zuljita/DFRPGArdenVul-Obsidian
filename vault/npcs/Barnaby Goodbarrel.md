# [[npcs/Barnaby Goodbarrel.md|Barnaby Goodbarrel]]

## Summary
[[npcs/Barnaby Goodbarrel.md|Barnaby Goodbarrel]] is a halfling lawyer practicing in [[Gosterwick]]. He is regarded by some, such as [[Wicktrimmer]], as the "second best lawyer in town." He provides legal services for company formation and contract law.

He was hired by the adventuring party to create their company charter and to review a high-value contract with the [[Rarities Factor]] for the sale of an artifact related to the legendary [[Larel]].

## Services & Fees
- **Initial Consultation:** $100
- **Company Charter ([[locations/Gosterwick.md|Gosterwick]]):** $500. This requires approval from [[Eusebia Phokas]], the [[Thesmothete of Vetucaster]], and can take several weeks. He accepted a $750 fee to "rush" the process.
- **Retainer:** For a starting fee of $500, Barnaby can be kept on retainer. This includes a confidentiality clause, makes him on-call for any work in [[locations/Gosterwick.md|Gosterwick]], and gives the client priority over others.

## Reputation
Barnaby has a reputation for keeping his word. He is also known for being exceptionally well-informed about the happenings in [[Gosterwick]], a trait some attribute to his practice of hiring wizards. He is motivated to be reliable as he competes with established Imperial Factors.
