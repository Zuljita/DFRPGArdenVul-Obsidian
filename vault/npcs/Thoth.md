# Thoth

## Summary
Deity associated with knowledge, libraries, and inscriptions throughout [[Arden Vul]]; many structures bear his name (e.g., [[locations/Pyramid of Thoth.md|Pyramid of Thoth]], [[locations/Library of Thoth.md|Library of Thoth]], [[locations/Glory of Thoth.md|Glory of Thoth]]). Mentions in sessions often describe statues, rituals, or sites dedicated to Thoth rather than direct manifestations.

## Notes

- A rumor suggests that while [[Thoth represented the light of knowledge that erased the darkness of ignorance, he was also the guardian of secrets, revealing his most potent wisdom only to the devout.
- Another rumor claims that the numerous statues of Thoth have eyes made of huge gemstones. Removing these gems is said to allow the bearer to contact Thoth directly, but doing so causes the statues to animate and attack. This is corroborated by a piece of graffiti found in the [[Pyramid of Thoth.
