# Arden

## Summary

Arden is one of the 20 Worthies of the Empire and a legendary hero who lived approximately 2100 years ago. Along with her partner, [[npcs/Vul the Sorcerer.md|Vul the Sorcerer]], she discovered the cavern system that would become the [[Halls of Arden Vul]]. The city founded there was later named in their honor.

## History & Lore

According to historical records, Arden completed eleven of the "Twelve Labors," which involved defeating a host of formidable foes like owlbears, trolls, undead, dragons, and Wiskin berserkers. The twelfth labor is said to be "still to be done at the time of the Empire's Need."

At the peak of their power, both Arden and Vul mysteriously disappeared, and their bodies were never recovered. Some popular tales claim that Arden did not die but ascended to a state of demi-godhood, though official histories dispute this.

### Cult of Arden
A [[factions/Cult of Arden.md|Cult of Arden]] was known to exist among the military officials in Arden Vul. This cult reportedly built their own headquarters within the Halls and attempted to replicate the famous Labors of Arden.

### The Twelve Labours of Arden
A book titled `[[items/The Twelve Labours of Arden.md|The Twelve Labours of Arden]]` is believed to be a guide for a puzzle that begins with a purification ritual at the fountain beneath the [[locations/Waterfall.md|waterfall]].
