# [[npcs/Arden.md|Arden]]

## Summary

[[npcs/Arden.md|Arden]] is one of the 20 Worthies of the Empire and a legendary hero who lived approximately 2100 years ago. Along with her partner, [[npcs/Vul the Sorcerer.md|Vul the Sorcerer]], she discovered the cavern system that would become the [[Halls of Arden Vul]]. The city founded there was later named in their honor.

## History & Lore

According to historical records, [[npcs/Arden.md|Arden]] completed eleven of the "Twelve Labors," which involved defeating a host of formidable foes like owlbears, trolls, undead, dragons, and [[factions/Wiskin.md|Wiskin]] berserkers. The twelfth labor is said to be "still to be done at the time of the Empire's Need."

At the peak of their power, both [[npcs/Arden.md|Arden]] and Vul mysteriously disappeared, and their bodies were never recovered. Some popular tales claim that [[npcs/Arden.md|Arden]] did not die but ascended to a state of demi-godhood, though official histories dispute this.

A [[factions/Cult of Arden.md|Cult of Arden]] was known to exist among the military officials in [[locations/[[npcs/Arden.md|Arden]] Vul.md|[[npcs/Arden.md|Arden]] Vul]]. This cult reportedly built their own headquarters within the Halls and attempted to replicate the famous Labors of [[npcs/Arden.md|Arden]].
