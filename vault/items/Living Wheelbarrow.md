# Living Wheelbarrow

The Living Wheelbarrow is a magical item created by the inventor [[Ashe Maykum]] under the company [[Alcheboretal Animossities]]. It was developed as part of his "Shroom for Improvement" prototype and was eventually ready for mass production.

## Properties
The underside of the wheelbarrow is covered in real, living plants. This unique feature allows the use of the [[Levitation]] spell, which is normally only usable on living things, rather than [[Apportation]]. This makes it significantly easier to transport than a standard wheelbarrow, as it can be floated over difficult terrain or up and down vertical shafts.

- **Capacity:** 360 pounds.
- **Handling:** It can be pushed or pulled with only a quarter of the strength necessary to move a ground-based wheelbarrow, and ignores difficult terrain. Easily raised or lowered across flights stairs or even vertical shafts through simple caster concentration.
- **Care:** Requires little more care than a house plant and can survive for days without sunlight.
- **Colors:** Available in Fungus White, Moss Green, and Yellow Rattle. Customizable colors and emblems are available for higher pledges.

## Known History
The Living Wheelbarrow was originally offered through a crowdfunding campaign with several pledge levels:
- **Adventurer Pledge (300 silver):** One [[Living Wheelbarrow]] in a color of choice. Free shipping to [[Gosterwick]]. Estimated delivery: Gerakios 2993.
- **Party Pledge (800 silver):** Three [[Living Wheelbarrow|Living Wheelbarrows]] (one in each color). Free shipping to [[Gosterwick]]. Estimated delivery: Gerakios 2993.
- **Trailblazer Pledge (2,000 silver):** A personalized wheelbarrow with a customized color emblem or design. Free shipping to [[Gosterwick]]. Estimated delivery: Basilembrios 2993.

[[Vael]] acquired a customized wheelbarrow, and both [[Ioannes]] and [[Onyx]] were "befuddled" by it initially. Deliveries for Adventurer and Party Pledges began by Gerakios 2993, with Trailblazer pledges focusing on unique designs.

## Warnings
The [[Living Wheelbarrow]] is not self-powered, self-propelled, or self-levitating. A competent caster and [[Levitation]] spell is required to make use of the levitating feature. Scroll use by untrained users may result in injury or equipment loss. Designs, components, and plant details are prototypes and subject to change.
