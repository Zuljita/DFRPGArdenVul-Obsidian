# Cult of Set

The Cult of Set is an ancient and officially banned religious group that worships the god [[Set]].

## The God Set
Set was a Greater God of the old pantheon (the Ten). He was the god of power, knowledge, domination, slavery, vengeance, and serpents.

## Follower Characteristics
The followers of Set, sometimes called Settites, are known for a few distinct characteristics:
- **Armor:** Red scale armor.
- **Weapons:** [[Was sticks]].
- **Creatures:** They use "[[Set animals]]", which are described as vicious dogs with square ears.

## History
Worship of Set was banned by imperial decree in 1839 AEP, over a thousand years ago. An organization known as the [[Drome]] claimed to have successfully eliminated the cult from the Empire shortly after the ban. Despite this, the cult persists.

## Activities & Lore
- **Slave Trade:** There are rumors that the [[Settite Guild of Service]] is a front for the cult's activities in buying and selling slaves.
- **Breeding Project:** An ancient text claims that the cult's temple in [[Arden Vul]] succeeded in a secret project to breed a fearsome species of animal that "shared all the attributes of Lord Set." This project was based in a secret cavern near the [[waterfall]].
- **Escaped Slaves:** A rumor was overheard in the [[Forum of Set]] where some of the red guardsmen were whispering about escaped slaves causing problems to the north. When questioned, they became officious and denied that anyone escapes the [[Settite Guild of Service]].
- **Antagonism towards "Right for Riches":** The cult has become a direct antagonist to the Right for Riches adventuring company. They are responsible for the murder of [[Susarra]] in [[Gosterwick]]. The cult's leader, the [[Pontifex]], has placed a bounty of $2,500 each on the heads of the entire party, with instructions to bring their remains to the [[Duty Deacon]] at the [[Forum of Set]] for payment.
