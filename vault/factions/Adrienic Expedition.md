# Adrienic Expedition

## Summary

A military expedition led by [[Archon Phocion IV]] approximately 250 years ago.

## History

The expedition was an attempt to retake [[Arden Vul]]. It was composed of six cohorts of legionaries: five from the "Sheepshead Rangers" and one from the emperor's own guards tagmata.

The expedition failed bloodily and all six cohorts were lost in a battle fought at the [[Cavern of Blood]], where their battle standards were also lost. The [[Haunted Tower]] at the base of the [[Waterfall]] was built during this expedition and abandoned when the survivors fled.

A rumor claims that the leader of the expedition, a certain "Adrienic" (presumably [[Archon Phocion IV]]), committed suicide rather than report his failure.
