## Notes
The [[Compact of Ennius]] was broken in 1588 AEP, leading to potential conflict or changed relations with human empires.

Approximately 50 years ago, a huge green dragon was encountered in the [[Arden Vul|ruins of Arden Vul]] by [[Lord Burdock]]'s men-at-arms. This encounter resulted in 10 out of 12 men, including three knights, being killed. This event led [[Lord Burdock]] to forbid further exploration of the ruins from the [[Burdock Valley]].
