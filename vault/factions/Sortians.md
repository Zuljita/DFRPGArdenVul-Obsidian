# Sortians

## Summary
The Sortians were a historical faction, now remembered as traitors, who instigated a civil war in 1698 AEP by rebelling against the established magical order.

## Beliefs and Practices
Led by [[Priscus Pulcher]], the Sortians believed that anyone with magical aptitude should be allowed to cast spells, challenging the control held by approved churches and colleges.

They were considered heretical for many reasons, including:
- Summoning demons.
- Allowing women and elves to hold leadership positions.
- Creating "graven images" in the form of magical statues of their leader for worship. Rituals involving these statues sometimes used magical eyes to achieve effects like passing messages or teleportation.

## History
The Sortians' rebellion against the established order led to a long and costly Civil War. The conflict is blamed for the abandonment of the [[Exarchate of Narsileon]] and setting the Empire back a thousand years.

Though the Empire survived with smaller borders and spell use was eventually opened up, the Sortians and their leader [[Priscus Pulcher]] (who was executed by an Exarch) are still considered traitors.

## Notes
- Information about them is found in the [[Book of Priors]] and in old books in the [[Library of Mitra]].
- Their leader, [[Priscus Pulcher]], is said to have resembled the statues known as "The Philosopher".
