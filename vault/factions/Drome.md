## Activities
- **Investigation of Susarra's Murder:** The Drome was officially informed of the murder of [[Susarra]] in [[Gosterwick]]. While they could not officially endorse a retaliatory attack on the [[Cult of Set]], they assisted the party's investigation by providing a blood sample of the victim for magical tracking.

## History
Following the imperial ban on the worship of [[Set]] in 1839 AEP, the Drome claimed to have successfully eliminated the [[Cult of Set]] everywhere in the Empire.

## Notes
The Drome operates under official sanction, but its members are sometimes willing to provide clandestine assistance to further their goals when they cannot act openly.
