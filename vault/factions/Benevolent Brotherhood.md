# Benevolent Brotherhood

## Summary

The Benevolent Brotherhood is a clandestine organization that provides training in the "Streetwise" skill, teaching individuals how to operate and sell goods anonymously in less-than-reputable circles.

## Modus Operandi
To gain their services, one must follow a specific procedure:
1. Obtain a contact at the [[Baliff's Truncheon]].
2. Visit the Brotherhood's public facade.
3. Leave contact information with the secretary, "[[Shirley]]", in a designated mailbox.
4. Await contact from a member, such as "[[Petros]]".
5. The member will provide a practical tour and training in the "less savory parts of the town."

## Services
- **Streetwise Training:** Practical lessons on how to sell items anonymously without getting robbed or cheated. They helped a client sell [[Set Armor]] for 40% of its value to a contact at [[The Docks]].

- [[Petros]] (possibly an alias): A member who provides hands-on training.
