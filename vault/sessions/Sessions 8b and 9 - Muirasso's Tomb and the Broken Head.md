## Summary
Continuing from the previous session, the party dealt with the immediate aftermath of [[npcs/Roskelly Winterleaf|Roskelly Winterleaf]]'s death. While this cemented their hostile relationship with [[npcs/Phlebotomas Plumthorn|Phlebotomas Plumthorn]]'s gang, the halfling leader did not surrender at this time.

The party then turned their attention back to the [[Tomb of Muirasso]]. They battled more undead minions before confronting the wight himself. During the fight, [[pcs/Ioannes Grammatikos Byzantios|Ioannes]] was drained of a level by Muirasso's life-draining touch. After a difficult battle, they defeated the wight and his minions, clearing the tomb. Their exploration also led them to the area of the [[Inn of the Broken Head]], a location featuring an enormous statue of a broken head.
