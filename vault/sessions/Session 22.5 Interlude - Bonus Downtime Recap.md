DFRPG Bonus Downtime Recap: Strange Happenings in [[locations/Gosterwick.md|Gosterwick]]
There's this idea in DFRPG that Town is a "safe zone".  PCs can shop and train there and don't have to worry about being robbed or murdered.

Is that true in [[locations/Gosterwick.md|Gosterwick]], 10 miles south of the ruins of [[locations/[[npcs/Arden.md|Arden]] Vul.md|[[npcs/Arden.md|Arden]] Vul]]?  Apparently not.

The Right for Riches company returned to [[locations/Gosterwick.md|Gosterwick]] after their successful mission to rescue Canon [[npcs/Lillian.md|Lillian]] of the Church of [[npcs/Mitra.md|Mitra]] from the dungeons of the Cult of [[npcs/Set.md|Set]]. This mission incidentally resulted in the deaths of about a dozen [[factions/Cult of [[npcs/Set.md|Set]].md|Cult of [[npcs/Set.md|Set]]]] guarding the path to [[npcs/Lillian.md|Lillian]]'s cell, plus about a dozen more [[factions/Cult of [[npcs/Set.md|Set]].md|Cult of [[npcs/Set.md|Set]]]] in the nearby Temple of [[npcs/Set.md|Set]] who just happened to be doing the wrong evil ritutal in the wrong place at the wrong time.  And a giant crocodile who took advantage of the chaos to try to eat an allied NPC.  While the PCs were in the Temple of [[npcs/Set.md|Set]], they also stole anything valuable looking that wasn't too heavy, including a couple of gigantic and incredibly valuable rubies from the largest cult statue's eyes.  And some of the PCs may or may not have urinated on a holy altar of [[npcs/Set.md|Set]]; the stories are inconsistent.





(Artistic interpretation of Uvash and Ioannes stealing the ruby eyes of the cult statue in the Temple of [[npcs/Set.md|Set]], over the corpse of the giant crocodile [[npcs/Susarra.md|Susarra]] killed, while Vael, Michael, Vallium, and an unidentified NPC discuss their next move.)
It appears that the Cult of [[npcs/Set.md|Set]] was not happy about any of this.  A few days after the Right for Riches Company returned to [[locations/Gosterwick.md|Gosterwick]], two things happened:

[[npcs/Coinbase.md|Coinbase]], leader of the [[factions/[[factions/Grudge Brigade.md|Grudge Brigade]].md|[[factions/Grudge Brigade.md|Grudge Brigade]]]], received an anonymous offer under his door.  It promised a payment of $2500 each for Vael, Vallium, Ioannes, Uvash, Michael, or [[npcs/Susarra.md|Susarra]], dead or alive.  They or their remains should be brought to the [[npcs/Duty Deacon.md|Duty Deacon]] in the [[locations/Forum of Set.md|Forum of Set]], who would then contact the [[npcs/Pontifex.md|Pontifex]] to verify the identify of the invader and pay the reward.  ([[npcs/Coinbase.md|Coinbase]] decided to sell the contract to Vael rather than acting on it.)
[[npcs/Susarra.md|Susarra]] was decapitated in her bed at the [[locations/Yellow Cloak Inn.md|Yellow Cloak Inn]].  Her head and the more valuable and portable parts of her gear were missing.  Vallium, who the innkeeper had seen with [[npcs/Susarra.md|Susarra]], was called in to identify the body, and then Vael showed up and asked for a blood sample from the victim.  His request was initially denied by the guards at the crime scene, while one of them added Vael's name to A List.  Later that denial was overruled by [[npcs/Audun Yellow-Eyes.md|Audun Yellow-Eyes]], head of the [[factions/Drome.md|Drome]] in [[locations/Gosterwick.md|Gosterwick]], who sent a blood sample to Vael.
Once he got the blood sample, Vael cast Seeker followed by Trace, revealing that [[npcs/Susarra.md|Susarra]]'s head was currently in a backpack tossed in a corner of a comfortable room, about ten miles north of [[locations/Gosterwick.md|Gosterwick]].  Vael could maintain the Trace spell as long as he could stay awake, but could not cast Seeker again for a week, so he advocated cutting short the usual week of downtime between delves and immediately going after whoever murdered [[npcs/Susarra.md|Susarra]].

To be continued...
