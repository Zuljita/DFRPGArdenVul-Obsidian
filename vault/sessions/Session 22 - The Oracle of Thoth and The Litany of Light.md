# DFRPG Arden Vul Session 22: The Oracle of [[npcs/Thoth.md|Thoth]] and The Litany of Light

Date: 
Basilsday, 9th of Gerakios, 2993 AE 


Weather: 

Hot, dry


Player Characters: 

[[pcs/Vael Sunshadow]], Half-Elven mage (Kyle)
[[pcs/Vallium Halcyon]], Archontean fighter (Greybrown)
[[pcs/Ioannes Grammatikos Byzantios]], Archontean cleric of Demma (Demented Avenger)
Merenuithiel "Lacrymosa" Armaris, Elven mercenary archer (Archon Shiva)


Significant NPCs:

6 ghouls
[[npcs/Yamki.md|Yamki]], wounded giant 4-armed intelligent baboon
Many large albino baboons
[[npcs/Anaximander.md|Anaximander]], ancient insane cleric of Mitra
Voice of Thoth, ancient god for magic, moons, secrets, etc.
Skeleton cook
Flaming skull
Animated bust of [[npcs/Stamelis.md|Stamelis]], Librarian of Thoth
2 Ibis constructs of Thoth


Ioannes did some research on the copy of the Litany of Light they had found in the [[locations/Library of Thoth.md|Library of Thoth]], which pointed to it being a forgery, so he wasn't sure if it was a good idea.  Vael learned the location spells Seeker, Pathfinder, and Trace, and tried using them to find the Troll Lifts and Lillian the missing cleric of Mitra.  Vallium tried and failed to find some magic scale armor, and decided not to put down a deposit on fine-quality scale armor.

Vallium decided the company should try to finish exploring the [[locations/Well of Light.md|Well of Light]] level (except the caves full of baboons), try installing the mirror below the Well of Light, and have Ioannes conduct the Litany of Light if willing and able.  Michael was still off in the mountains somewhere and Uvash had a church emergency, so the shorthanded party hired Lacrymosa the bloodthirsty elf archer.  She asked if it was time to kill the halflings yet, then came along to kill whatever else they needed her to kill.

They got up early on a sunny Basilsday, made good time to the cliff face beneath Arden Vul, then tied themselves together and climbed up the [[locations/Long Stair.md|Long Stair]] (except Vael, who didn't believe in climbing when you could Levitate).  They made it to the top without any problems and hiked to the top of the Well of Light.  Vael cast Flight on Vallium, who carried Ioannes down the Well, while Vael Levitated down and Lacrymosa used Walk on Air to walk down the well as if there were an invisible spiral staircase.  This time, there were no baboon hordes waiting for them at the bottom, so they were able to rest safely.

They went west, then north, and found a door that was spiked shut.  They prepared for battle and Vallium ripped the spikes out.  Opening the door revealed 6 angry ghouls.  A quick fight ensued, where Vallium stabbed the ghouls, Lacrymosa show the ghouls, Ioannes finished off one ghoul with his axe, and Vael supervised while preparing a Great Haste spell just in case they needed it.  They did not.  Digging through the trash in the room found a few platinum coins, a tall bronze magic helmet shaped like an inverted flowerpot, and a wand.  They grabbed the treasure, unspiked a second door into the room for good measure, then continued exploring north and west.

Eventually they doubled back and explored south and west.  They found an empty room, then a room with Continual Light, a fresco of an ibis with orange glowing eyes, a scroll along the wall full of obscure phrases in Mithric, and three blocks of granite shaped like open mouths, with black holes of magical darkness.  They explored the room for a while, until the ibis's eyes flashed and a burst of energy filled the chamber, dispelling all their spells (including all their Blesses, all their Continual Light rocks, and Vael's Levitation) and destroying some of their potions.

After depositing their surviving potions outside the room in case that reoccurred, Vael cast a Light spell into the air, then cast Trace on his Returning Pebble and threw it into the eastern mouth.  He sensed that it teleported way down and northeast, then was still.  A few minutes later, the dispelling effect repeated, taking out both the Light and the Trace.  The Returning Pebble eventually returned, and Vael returned the experiment with the middle mouth.  This time the pebble went down and in the direction he threw it, as if there were stairs or a ramp there.  He waited until the second Trace was dispelled and the Pebble reappeared in his pocket, then returned the experiment with the western mouth.  This one seemed like another teleporter, moving the stone down and southeast.

Meanwhile, Ioannes, re-cast Bless on his other companions, who stayed out of the room to keep from having it dispelled again.  He finally cast it on Vael, and then everyone crawled into the magical mouth.  After going through a brief area of magical Darkness and Silence, they emerged onto narrow stairs leading down, then the passage turned west and they went down some more, until they reached a dead end with a square hole in the ceiling.  Vael re-cast Levitation and popped up into a hemispherical room containing an dais with a magical marble chair and a ibis statue whose wings wrapped around the chair.  In the chair sat a very old, disheveled man who was twitching and mumbling.

Everyone climbed up into the room.  The man did not respond.  Everyone tried talking to him, but he did not respond.  Eventually Vallium pulled the man out of the chair, and then the man noticed them, but did not speak coherently, just babbled about things they mostly did not understand.  It took a lot of prodding to reveal that his name was Anaximander, he was a cleric of Mitra, and he'd been in that chair for a very long time.  Ioannes told the others to pull him out if anything weird happened, then sat in the chair.  He felt a warm layer of air, then a deep voice told him to "Speak Thy Desire."  Ioannes said that he wanted to know the correct way to perform the Litany of Light.  The voice told him that he already had a book that said exactly how to do it, and that instructions could not get much more detailed that that, but maybe he could find a version with more pictures.  Ioannes was then stunned.  After a couple of minutes, Vallium pulled Ioannes out of the chair, and he soon recovered.

The old guy asked a few jealous questions about how Ioannes had gotten answers and said maybe it was a good idea to bring friends along to pull him out of the chair.  While he rocked on the floor, the group went out an exit to the south, into a room with a magic pool, whose water was overflowing the basin and streaming out of the room to the southeast.  Vael cast Analyze Magic, which said that the pool was designed to increase its user's intelligence.  That was enough for Ioannes, who immediately took a drink and felt smarter.  Impressed, Vael also took a drink, but felt sicker rather than smarter, then felt his guts twisting.  Ioannes cast a couple of Stop Bleeding spells and a Major Healing on Vael to help repair the damage, and the poisoning eventually subsided.  Vallium explored the water damage crack, but it wasn't big enough to go far, and he didn't find anything in the water.

Returning to the Oracle room, the group grabbed Anaximander and headed back up the stairs.  They left the dispelling room before it got another chance to ruin their spells, and headed for the Library of Thoth.  There they introduced Anaximander to the animated bust of Stemelis, and let the two ancient guys keep each other company while they explored more.

Vael found a secret door north of the kitchen, which led to a dusty narrow corridor.  In the corridor was a skeleton with a chef's hat and a cleaver, who was angry at the intrusion.  He was only one skeleton though, and Vallium and Lacrymosa finished him off pretty quickly.  The skeleton had a scroll in its hand that turned out to be a recipe for baboon stew, which they took.  Continuing east, they found another secret door at the other end of the passage which led to an area north of the baboon cave.  They saw Yamki, the giant 4-armed baboon they had wounded before, leaning on a stick, standing in the entrance to the cave watching them.  Neither side made any threatening moves, and the group moved away from the baboons.

They went north to a room with a baboon statue and a door they had not tried before.  The door had a picture of an ear on it, so everyone listened to it, but heard nothing.  It was locked, and Vallium pulled out his collection of keys.  The first one he tried fit, and he unlocked the door, but a needle trap was triggered.  He pulled his hand out of the way in time to avoid being pricked, if there was ever any chance of the needle penetrating his armored gauntlets.  After some brief discussion of whether they could try to recover poison from the needle, they decided the risk to reward ratio was poor, and Vallium carefully broke off the needle and threw it into a corner.

The room to the north was large, with columns, a dais in the center, and an opening to the Great Chasm to the east.  Vallium checked out the chasm, while Ioannes and Vael looked at the dais.  There was an ivory oliphant, and a Mithric note that said to "Name Thyself and Whisper They Message and Thou Shalt Be Rewarded in Thine Ear."  Vael complied, but the message he received was some stupid song about 99 flagons of ale on the wall.  Ioannes also tried, and heard a very deep voice saying "Me hide pretty rock in water.  Nobody find it now!"

Looking over the chasm, Vael thought he saw something to the southeast.  He Levitated over the chasm to inspect a creepy magical soapstone idol of some kind of salamander, with empty eye sockets and a gaping mouth.  He came back and cast Flight on Vallium so that Vallium could carry the others over the chasm.  They avoided the statue and explored a cave filled about 3 feet deep in bones.  After not finding anything in the bones for a few minutes, Vael searched for secret doors, and found a concealed exit to the east.   He then cast Seek Magic, then Seek Earth twice, for gold and platinum.  When these spells revealed nothing in this room and platinum off to the east, he suggested they stop searching and go east.

It led to a large round cavern, with a shaft in the middle, in which there was a huge creepy triangular obelisk, clearly crafted not natural.  The obelisk continued up about 20' above their heads, and down farther than their Continual Light went.  Vael Levitated up to the top of the obelisk and saw a pentagram on top, with a metal coffer within the pentagram.  He avoided touching the pentagram and tried Apportating the coffer open, but it appeared to be welded shut.  He looked at the pentagram to see if it looked like platinum, but it looked more like silver to him.  

Vael flew back down, informed the others, then flew down the obelisk about 90' without seeing the bottom.  Not wanting to stray too far, he flew back up, cast Trace on his Returning Pebble, and dropped it.  It fell about 150' before stopping.  Vael then flew down to the bottom and found the obelisk sat in a natural cave, with nothing very interesting within range of his light.  Not wanting to explore solo, he returned to the others.

Leaving the obelisk, they went north down a narrow tunnel until they found two bodies, one wearing slightly glowing orange mail, in front of a stone chest.  As they inspected the bodies, a flaming skull flew out of the wall to attack Vallium.  He parried, and a quick combat ensued, where Vallium kept stabbing it (while not doing much damage, as his sword mostly passed through the flames) and Lacrymosa tried both arrows and her cloak.  Eventually Vallium scored three critical hits in a row and the skull was dispelled.  They searched the bodies and found a small magic silver eye, a few coins, a scroll, and a couple of potions.

Iaonnes went to open the chest but Vael yelled him away and tried using Apportation instead.  That failed because the chest was locked.  Vael thought he noticed some writing on the chest and cautioned the others against reading it.  Eventually he opened the chest with a Lockmaster spell followed by an Apportation, without setting off any traps.  Inside the chest were a bunch of silver coins, a few of the extremely valuable huge ancient octagonal platinum coins, a magic silver torc, another copy of the Litany of Light (this one much shorter and less fancy than the one from the library), a magic pick, and a few potions.

With their desire for treasure temporarily met, they went back to the Well of Light to try replacing the mirror and saying the Litany of Light.  Vael cast Flight on Vallium again so he could ferry the others across the chasm, and then everyone went back to the library.  Stamelis looked ready to have Anaximander taken off his hands, then was disappointed when Vallium just grabbed the huge mirror from behind the stacks and went right back out the door.  Vallium maneuvered the mirror onto the tripod while Vael and Ioannes gave helpful hints.  Eventually they placed it correctly and light went out in all directions, then Vael went to play with some of the secondary mirrors and bounce the light around.

With the mirror in place, Ioannes conducted the Litany of Light.  He went to the four small rooms surrounding the Well of Light, and in each room said the correct Mithric words.  His poor Mithric pronunciation was just good enough to trigger each effect, and he ended up with Infravision, an intelligence bonus, See Secrets, and Invisibility.  Vael and Vallium followed him around and repeated the rituals, and each of them got the same bonuses.  Lacrymosa did not participate.  With See Secrets in effect, everyone started running around looking for secret doors.  They found one northeast of the [[items/Ruby Chair.md|Ruby Chair]], and another one northwest.

They opened the secret door northeast of the Ruby Chair (with the hidden catch on the floor made obvious by Thoth's blessing) and went east into a room, with an apparently accurate magically animated star field on the ceiling (despite it being daytime outside), and a couple of mosaics, one depicting the room with the Ruby Chair, another depicting some unknown large room with a bunch of statues.  They continued east to find a room with a couple of corpses, which Ioannes thought had been killed by some kind of strong impaling damage.  Both were wearing red ceremonial robes and hats.  One had a belt pouch, which they took without opening.  Another was lying on a big bronze key.  One was wearing magic boots.  They took all the loot but left the old rotted robes and hats.

Continuing east, they found a room containing two ibis statues.  The statues unfortunately did not seem to like visitors, and animated and attacked Lacrymosa, the only visible intruder.  Looking at their beaks, Ioannes now had a pretty good idea how the corpses to the west had been impaled.  Invisible Vallium had a free shot at the back of one of the constructs, and hit it squarely, but not hard enough to take it down.  Lacrymosa ran away while rapidly firing arrows, which the other construct dodged with amazing speed.  Ioannes and Vael tried to stay out of the way and stay Invisible.  After a few more tries, Lacrymosa finally managed to nail one of the constructs in the leg, slowing it and knocking it down.  It didn't dodge so well after that, and stopped moving after a few more arrows hit it.  Meanwhile Vallium landed a second, harder hit on the other ibis to slow it, then finished it off.  With See Secrets still running, everyone noticed a secret door on the south wall behind where one of the constructs had been standing, but nobody opened it.

In a hurry to go home, the party took a quick look to the east and saw a dead-end room with some spiral stairs down.  They then doubled back, closing the secret door behind them.  They went back to the Library, retrieved Anaximander, then went back to [[locations/Gosterwick.md|Gosterwick]].  Vallium took Anaximander to the Temple of Mitra to see if they could help him, while Vael and Ioannes went back to the Arcane Practitioners Club to start identifying their loot.



GM's Comments:


That was an exceptionally productive delve.  All the previous visits to the Well of Light level had been interrupted by periodic baboon attacks, but with the baboons apparently herded into the Howling Caves to the southeast, there were fewer interruptions this time, which made exploration easier.

Using a Trace spell on the Returning Pebble was a creative way to figure out what the 3 dark mouths did, without actually risking crawling in.  Vael used a lot of caution this session, not touching the salamander statue or the pentagram on top of the obelisk, and trying to open every container with Apportation rather than his hands, but still got poisoned by the magic pool.

Anaximander seemed too crazy to give the party useful information, but Ioannes still dared climbing into the marble chair that they pulled Anaximander out of, and got an answer about the Litany of Light.

Replacing the mirror and performing the Litany of Light correctly got four useful magical effects with long (but not permanent) durations.  See Secrets revealed three secret doors, two in areas the group had walked past before without searching.  And Invisibility gave Vallium a free rear attack on the ibis construct, which contributed to quickly winning that battle.

Next week:

They left a couple of secret doors and a staircase unexplored at the end of the session, so they'll probably be back.  Though there was some talk of trying to rescue Lillian, the canon of the Temple of Mitra in Newmarket, now that Vael has some knowledge magic that might make it easier to find her.  (Of course there was also talk of killing Plumthorn's halflings, but pretty much only from Lacrymosa, who always wants to kill the halflings.)

DFRPG Arden Vul Session 23a: Gelatinous Cube and Slime Kraken
Date: 
Basilsday, 16th of Gerakios, 2993 AE 


Weather: 

Hot, dry


Player Characters: 

Vael Sunshadow, Half-Elven mage (Kyle)
Vallium Halcyon, Archontean fighter (Greybrown)
Ioannes Grammatikos Byzantios, Archontean cleric of Demma (Demented Avenger)
[[pcs/Michael J. Dundee.md|Michael J. Dundee]], Thorcin barbarian (Adam)
[[pcs/Uvash Edzuson.md|Uvash Edzuson]], Dwarven cleric of Zodarrim (Cosmo)


Significant NPCs:

Lillian, captured Canon of Mitra
Kronos, Innkeeper at the Sign of the Broken Head
4 Ghouls
Gelatinous Cube
Slime Kraken
Susarra, Archontean fighter
Several [[npcs/Set.md|Set]] guards


Vallium formulated a plan to rescue Lillian.  They would avoid the halflings, bribe the beastmen (who rumor claimed had taken Lillian) with food for information on Lillian or for her release, bring her back to the Church of Mitra, and profit.

The first part of the plan went pretty well.  They loaded up their mule with food and took it up to the ruins of Arden Vul.  Not wanting to take the mule into the Halls, they instead took it to the Sign of the Broken Head and paid Kronos for boarding.  They then loaded the food into a wheelbarrow, went down through the basement entrance to avoid the halflings, and headed south toward the beastmen.

On the way, they searched for secret doors in the Thothian burial niches, and found one.  Opening it up found a crypt containing some elaborate sarcophagi and 4 angry ghouls.  The ghouls surprised Michael, but failed to hurt him.  A quick battle ensued, with Michael and Vallium smacking down the ghouls.  The grave goods included a couple of magical white gold rings, a high quality spear, and some silver torcs and alabaster urns.  The party took the light loot and left the heavy stuff in the secret tomb to grab on the way out.

As they approached beastman territory, Vael cast Seeker looking for Lillian.  The spell showed her bound, gagged, and injured, in a prison cell.  It said the cell was somewhere to the northwest, away from the beastmen.  Vael followed up the Seeker with a Trace so he could keep homing in on Lillian.  At that point they decided to turn around and not talk to the beastmen after all, since it appeared they didn't have Lillian.

They went north and west until they reached the room with 3 portcullises and 3 levers.  Vael, who hadn't been there before, wanted to go up the stairs to the south, but Vallium explained that it led to parts of the Well of Light lever that they had not fully explored, and pulled him back on target.  Vael, not wanting to touch anything he didn't have to, used Apportation to move the middle lever and open the middle portcullis.  They then headed west into a maze of catacombs, filled with burial niches whose plugs had been removed.  Knowing it would take forever to search all the niches, everyone kept their eyes open for obvious doors or treasure, but nobody took time to search.

At one point Uvash was in the lead and almost ran right into a nearly invisible form ahead.  He saw some coins just hanging in the air, and stopped before becoming enveloped.  It was a large gelatinous cube.  Uvash backed away and called for help, as the others ran up.  The cube was huge but fairly slow.  Uvash was a bit worried that it might damage his fancy mace, but took a swing at it anyway, and did a bit of damage.  Michael and Vallium ran up and started rapidly hacking at it.  It kept trying to hit them with slimy pseudopods, but didn't aim very well.  Eventually they hit it enough that it slowed down further and stopped dodging effectively, and then they just kept hitting it until it stopped twitching.

There were some coins and gems inside the cube's body, along with a wand.  Michael, wearing heavy armor and a Ring of Free Action, was able to crawl in and grab the gems and wand without getting hurt, but his armor was smoking a bit.  Manually getting all the coins didn't seem worth the risk, but since coins are pretty sturdy, Vael used Create Fire to just melt the remains of the cube to ash, and they picked the coins out of the remains.

They found a door heading south, but it had no obvious handle, did not budge when they tried pushing it open, and appeared too strong to break down without mining tools.  Vael tried using Apportation to push the door in every direction, but his spell failed to move the door.  Giving up, the group resumed walking around the catacombs looking for secret doors.  Ioannes found one to the northwest, but it led to stairs down, and Vael was pretty sure Lillian was on this level, so they didn't go that way.

Giving up on finding another door, they went back to the heavy door, and Vael used Shape Earth to dig a small tunnel through the rock a few yards away from the door.  His first couple of tries didn't go far enough, but eventually he managed to dig a small tunnel through to another room.  Vallium volunteered to crawl through it first, and didn't find anything dangerous in the room, just the bodies of a couple of humans and a couple of ghouls.  Everyone else crawled in, and they looted a shortsword and a ring.  There was a door on the north wall, which led to a short passage and then the door they had been unable to open from the other side.  From this side, it was possible to push it open with enough effort.  However, it closed itself shortly after they stopped pushing on it, and nobody had any spikes to keep it open.

Heading east, they found another room with doors south and east.  The southern door was spiked shut.  Vael confirmed that Lillian was still southwest, so they pulled the spikes and went south.  They saw doors south and west.  The western room was small and completely trashed.

To the south, however, was a very large room, containing a circular pool with a statue of Thoth inside it.  The temple had been thoroughly and deliberately trashed, and both clerics felt like it was a place of negative sanctity.  There was some anti-Thoth graffiti on the walls, and a picture of a crocodile eating an ibis, indicating that the vandalism was probably the work of Settites.  Worse, when Vallium went into the room, a lot of tentacles emerged from the pool to grab him.  Everyone retreated back north out of the room, with Vallium chopping off a couple of the tentacles as he parried their attacks.

After some discussion, the group decided they needed to get past the tentacle beast, but since they now knew it was there, they could buff themselves first.  Vael would cast Great Haste on the fighters, while Ioannes cast Flaming Weapon.  Vael flubbed his first couple of attempts to Great Haste Michael, but the third try worked, and then Michael opened the door and charged south.  He ran right into the pool, not slowed because of his Ring of Free Action, and started cutting off tentacles as the slime kraken tried dragging him under.  At one point it looked like Michael critically failed an attack and crippled his own shield arm, but his Bless spell sacrificed itself and prevented the self-inflicted attack.  A few seconds later, Vallium also came charging into the room at double speed, and now the slime beast was surrounded.  Both Vallium and Michael kept cutting off tentacles, then went after its body.  With all its tentacles gone, the beast started biting with its beak.  Uvash used Divine Grace then followed them into the room, but Michael finished the slime creature off with multiple rapid strikes from behind before Uvash arrived.

With the battle over, Vael was very tired after casting multiple Great Hastes, and Vallium and Michael were tired from fighting.  While they rested, Ioannes started searching and found a magical sheet of yellow glass in the pool.  Rather than reaching into the murky water, he Apportated it out.  After resting, everyone started circling the room and looking for secret doors.  Vael found a secret door in the north wall, with a small empty alcove behind it.  Later he searched in the same spot on the south wall and found a matching secret door and empty alcove.  There were doors in all four corners of the rooms.  Both of the ones on the east side led to ramps up to galleries overlooking the temple.  One of the ramps had a bit of adventuring equipment left on it, and Vallium grabbed some spikes.

The most promising door, in the southwest corner, led to a small passage south, another door, and a cave-in.  The cave in was large enough that Vael did not feel he could use Shape Earth to get past it.  Everyone returned to the temple and searched again for secret doors.  They did not find any, but Uvash spotted an iron key in the fountain, which Vael Apportated out, dried off, and added to their keyring.

Giving up on manually searching, Vael pulled out the Wand of See Secrets and used a charge.  At that point a secret door to the southwest and a peephole high on the west wall became obvious to him.  He ran around the temple while the spell lasted, finding another secret door off the southeast gallery.  He then doubled back north through the other rooms they had searched.  He did not find any more secret doors there.  There was one door to the east which they had not opened, and, caution thrown aside while racing the spell duration, Vael opened it rather than waiting for Vallium and Michael to catch up.  There was an armed and armored woman hiding in the room.  Fortunately for Vael, she did not attack, and instead asked who he was and what he was doing there.  Vael didn't want to talk, as he was trying to find secret doors, but he explained that they were looking for Lillian.  The woman didn't know who Lillian was, but said that her name was Susarra and her friends had been killed by ghouls and she was looking for a way out past the tentacle monster.  When Vael indicated that they had killed the monster and invited her to tag along, she followed him out of the room.

They listened to the southwestern secret door, opened it, and found a room full of trash.  There were some footprints leading from the secret door to the middle of the room, then vanishing.  Everyone started searching for more secret doors.  While searching, Vallium triggered a spear trap.  It barely penetrated his helmet, scratching his face.  Vallium broke the spear in half to make sure that didn't happen again.  They eventually found a concealed door on the south wall.

When they opened the door, a trap went off, and gas started pouring into the room with a loud hiss.  Everyone managed to hold their breath before breathing any of the gas, and then Vael cast a Purify Air to clear the room.  The group went south through the door, and saw some Set guards in their distinctive red scale armor, looking angry.  There wasn't enough time left in the session to fight the battle, so the session ended there.


GM's Comments:

Slime Kraken might be my new favorite monster name.

Gelatinous Cubes are fun, but they're also slow and stupid, so unless they surprise you and get a free attack, or corner you, they're not as dangerous as they seem.

You would think that the combination of Seeker and Trace and Shape Earth would make reaching a prisoner within one four-hour session pretty easy.  Find the prisoner, head toward the prisoner, and if you can't find a way toward the prisoner, dig one.  But four hours flew by this week, despite only finishing three fights.


Achievements:

None

XP:

None until they get back to down, but they explored some new territory and found a bit of loot.


Next Week:

We know they'll be starting the session fighting those Set guards, and then, if they win, presumably resuming the search for Lillian.

DFRPG Arden Vul Session 23b: Disrupting Services in the Temple of Set
Date: 
Basilsday, 16th of Gerakios, 2993 AE 


Weather: 

Hot, dry


Player Characters: 

Vael Sunshadow, Half-Elven mage (Kyle)
Vallium Halcyon, Archontean fighter (Greybrown)
Ioannes Grammatikos Byzantios, Archontean cleric of Demma (Demented Avenger)
Michael J. Dundee, Thorcin barbarian (Adam)
Uvash Edzuson, Dwarven cleric of Zodarrim (Cosmo)


Significant NPCs:

Lillian, captured Canon of Mitra
Susarra, Archontean fighter
Many Set guards
Many Set cultists
Several Set acolytes
Several Set deacons

Continuing from the previous session, Vallium came through the gas-trapped doorway, with Vael, Ioannes, and Susarra close behind him.  Uvash and Michael were well behind.  There was one Set guard in red scale armor peering around a corner ahead, shouting back reports to his allies.  Vallium charged, while yelling for nobody to stand right behind him.  The guard waited until Vallium was two yards away to fire his crossbow -- and somehow missed.  Whether this was due to Vallium's Amulet of Missile Shield, or the guard just panicking, was hard to tell.

The guard backed around the corner.  There was a short staircase up, with a 4' tall barricade at the top, and several more guards behind the barricade, holding crossbows.  A couple more took shots at Vallium as he and the first guard ran up the stairs, then dropped their crossbows and pulled out maces or potions.  Meanwhile Michael and Uvash caught up to Vael, who cast Great Haste on Michael.

Vallium neared the barricade as a couple of the guards threw down Alchemist's Fire potions, but missed him.  By then Michael was double-timing up the stairs behind him, and Vael was near the bottom of the steps casting a Grease spell.  The Set deacon at the top of the stairs concentrated on a spell for a couple of seconds, so Vallium let go of his sword (letting it hang from a lanyard), reached into his potion belt, and smashed a Magebane potion.  This emitted a sickly smoke that kept everyone within a few yards of Vallium from casting wizard spells for a while -- but the caster was a cleric and was not affected.  He finished his Dispel Magic spell, catching Vallium and Michael and Susarra in it.  He was trying to dismiss Vallium's Missile Shield (which failed because it was a permanent magic item, not a spell) and Michael's Great Haste.  The attempt was successful, and also dismissed a couple of Continual Light rocks as well as Vallium's Bless.

It didn't get the Grease though, which was cast behind the barricade outside the area of effect of the Dispel, and the guards started slipping and sliding.  Michael stabbed the one on the stairs.  Vallium recovered his sword and hit a couple behind the barricade.  Susarra got to the barricade and got a couple of axe swings in.  As the battle turned against his side, the deacon commanded one of the unwounded guards to run north and set reinforcements.  A badly wounded guard broke ranks and followed him.  After taking a hit, the deacon retreated west.  Uvash reached the top and opened the gate in the barricade, and the party poured through.  They eventually took down all but one of the guards, but the one survivor ran north into an area with a red tiled floor, pulled open a black curtain, and ran into the large room beyond while yelling for help.

Vallium used his Ring of Illusion Disguise to look like the cleric they had just defeated, whose guards had called Deacon Hurub.  He followed the guard into the big temple room to the north while yelling "The Azure Knights are attacking, there are too many, retreat."  A couple of set clerics were leading many cultists in a service nearby.  Many of the cultists broke and ran in various directions.  Vallium waited at the curtain for a few seconds, while Vael cast Great Haste on both Vallium and Michael, and Ioannes followed up with Flaming Weapon.  Once they were fully buffed, everyone ran into the temple.  Michael chased the retreating guard to the west, trailed by Vael, and eventually caught and killed him, but by then about eight more guards were streaming out of two rooms north and south.  Uvash and Ioannes and Susarra went east toward a huge statue of Set in Set animal form, and killed a few cultists.  Vallium chased some clerics to the northeast into a room with a portcullis, and killed them both before they got it open.  There was a brief difference of opinion about who was the real cleric of Set and who was the traitor or imposter, but Vallium won the argument using his sword, and the nearby cultists helped him finish off the acolyte.

Michael was beset by a lot of guards, but he had Great Haste, and Vael cast two Grease spells and a Smoke spell among the guards to help him.  Michael eventually downed all of them.  Meanwhile Susarra ran between two long rectangular pools to come help Michael, when a huge crocodile unexpectedly emerged from one of the pools and tried to eat her.  She avoided being surprised and eventually killed it with a couple of solid axe blows.  A second crocodile came out later, and she wounded it badly enough that it went back under the water to hide and wait for easier prey.

Uvash and Ioannes, after running out of nearby cultists, decided to try to desecrate the evil temple.  Ioannes first tried to knock over the huge statue, but it was just too heavy.  They then decided to take its ruby eyes.  The statue was 25' tall, so its eyes were well out of reach.  Uvash climbed up the statue with his Ring of Climbing, then dropped a rope to help Ioannes up, since Ioannes had the Apportation spell and could take the rubies without actually touching them.  This plan worked, and Ioannes magically grabbed two huge rubies and dropped them in Uvash's pouch, before climbing back down.  Ioannes then stole everything he could find on the Settites' evil sacrificial altar.  He and Uvash then knocked it over.

Vallium chased down and killed two more deacons who were trying to escape down a wide staircase to the west, then dragged them back into the temple and took their portable valuables.  He and Vael shut the huge bronze doors, and Vael Magelocked them.  Vael ran around the room looking for magic items, and Susarra explored the temple looking for other valuables.  Everyone then retreated to the room to the south, outside the temple's Set-aligned sanctity, to rest and heal.  Both Michael and Susarra were fairly wounded, so Ioannes used Stop Bleeding and Major Healing to patch them up.

After the long battle, and with the Set Cult fully alerted to their presence, it was time to decide whether to head back to Gosterwick or press on looking for Lillian.  The group unanimously decided to keep looking for Lillian rather than retreating, so they ended the session, very close to where they started it, but surrounded by a lot of dead Settites (and one dead crocodile).


GM's Comments:

This was by far the biggest battle we've fought in this campaign, 5 PCs and an NPC against over 20 Settites and a couple of crocodiles.  It took almost the whole session.  I should have taken some screenshots.



Achievements:

None


XP:

None until they get back to town, but they explored even more new territory and found some more loot.


Next Week:

They're pretty sure they're close to Lillian now, so they're going to try to rescue her and get out before whatever portion of the Set cult is left gets their revenge.

We resumed in the dungeon, after the party killed or chased off everyone in the Temple of Set and spent a few minutes looting.  The group retreated south out of the temple, back into the guard room atop the barricade, where until the sanctity level (for non-Settites) went back to normal, then rested.  They then searched the western wall, where the Set deacon had been running, and found a door concealed behind a screen.  They went west through a torture chamber, then through a black curtain into some kind of waiting room with pews, then south into a robing room.  There were some red Settite robes there, but not enough for everyone, and Uvash refused to wear them anyway.  With some of the group disguised and some not, they searched for secret doors and found one on the south wall, leading to a narrow spy corridor. Heading west, they found some peepholes into a prison, with seven cells, six prisoners (including Lillian), and four guards.  Without a way into the prison from here, they doubled back north, east, and then south down some stairs.

Suddenly some candles lining the stairs start smoking, and loud screams came from somewhere.  Magically alerted, several guards poured out of a room to the southeast.  A six-on-six battle commenced.  Susarra, Vallium, and Michael filled the corridor to the south, with Uvash, Vael, and Ioannes behind them.  On the other side were 4 Set guards, a Set torturer with a long whip, and a Set wizard who was throwing Force Missiles at Michael from the doorway.




The Set ranks held for a few seconds, while Vael cast Great Haste on Michael.  Then once Michael started attacking twice as fast, he downed an enemy and charged forward to get the wizard, while Uvash moved up to fill the hole on the left.  Vallium and Susarra kept holding the line and stabbing Settites, and Ioannes cast several Stop Bleeding and Major Healing spells to keep his allies up.  As the Settites started to fall, they yelled for help, and reinforcements started coming from the west.  It was the four guards the party had seen before, plus a jailer they had not spotted.




As the original Settites to the east fell, the battle moved west toward the approaching reinforcements.  Vael dropped a Grease spell in the hallway, which resulted in several Settites missing attack or defense rolls or falling over.  Michael, with his Ring of Free Action, was unaffected by the bad footing, and mercilessly hacked through the Settites before his Great Haste could run out.  Susarra and Uvash and Vallium followed behind him, staying out of the Grease but helping finish the Settites.  Eventually, all 11 of the Settites went down.

Vael and Michael were exhausted after the battle, so took a few minutes to rest, with Ioannes casting Lend Energy.  Once everyone could stand up, they took a preliminary pass over the bodies looking for magical loot, then they went west.  They heard a woman yelling from behind an open door to the north.  In the room was the jailer's prisoner Eadgithu, manacled to the wall.  Vallium grabbed the jailer's key ring and tried keys until one freed her, at which point Eadgithu thanked them and went to grab a sword off the jailer's body.  Vael saw a lockbox in the room and cautiously opened it using the keys and an Apportation spell, finding some coins and gems and a spellbook.  The group then went west to the prison.

There were 6 prisoners visible.  Three of them (Lillian, an overweight man, and a tough-looking man) were manacled to the back of their cells and gagged.  The other three (a goblin, a fishman, and a well-muscled dwarf) were not tied or gagged.  Half of the prisoners showed obvious wounds, while the others appeared to be in better shape.  Vallium used the jailer's keys to free Lillian first, and Ioannes healed her wounds.  She then explained who some of the other prisoners were.  She said the tough-looking man was Azgallatu, a warrior cleric of Mitra who had been captured trying to find her, and he should definitely be freed.  She stated that the goblin (who showed no wounds) was some high-ranking noble captive, at which point Gribble interrupted to introduce himself and said he was the brother of King Wiskenim, who would certainly reward his rescuers.  Lillian and Gribble agreed that the fishman was unfriendly and also didn't seem to speak any languages they knew, so he was left in his cell.  The overweight man was Geleg, a wizard, who when ungagged immediately thanked his rescuers then asked if anyone had seen his spellbook.  Vael admitted to having found a spellbook but asked if he could copy any spells, and Geleg immediately agreed to let Vael copy anything he wanted.  The dwarf seemed a bit unfriendly, so Vallium passed the keys to Uvash to deal with him.  Grist asked Uvash several questions, apparently suspicious that he might be a doppleganger, before agreeing that he was an actual dwarf and warming up slightly.  He was badly wounded, so he appreciated the healing spell Ioannes gave him.  Azgallatu, when freed, thanked the party then immediately took up position at Lillian's side.

With a horde of rescued prisoners in tow, the party went back east to loot the room at the bottom of the stairs.  There were several heads mounted on the walls, of a lion, some kind of reptile man, a member of Gog's species, and a goblin.  The goblin head appeared to be magical.  Gribble wanted to throw it in a nearby disposal hole, but because it was magical Vael argued that it couldn't be left where the Settites could recover it, so Gribble reluctantly put it in a chest (where he didn't have to look at it) and carried it out.  Meanwhile each of the other prisoners was asked to carry a suit of red Set scale armor.  So burdened, the group went back north up the stairs, east over the barricade, north through the gas-trapped room (the trap had not reset), and back into the desecrated temple of Thoth were the slime kraken had been killed.

There was some debate on whether to go north or east.  Vallium argued that east was closer to the halflings so north was safer.  Ioannes countered that with so many of them, the halflings would probably be too scared to fight.  But the decision was made to go north and try to avoid contact.  Vael re-cast Shape Earth to cover the ends of the passage he had made next to the one-way door, and everyone went north through the one-way door then east through the catacombs to the portcullis.  They closed the portcullis behind them, then went south through the burial niches to the secret room where they had stashed a wheelbarrow full of food.

Vael and Vallium wanted to give the food to someone rather than waste it, so they asked Lillian the story of her capture.  She said she had been looking for Settite activity when she had been grabbed by the Green Fang Kobolds, who traded her to the beastmen, who traded her to the Settites, who threw her in their jail and tortured her.  This dropped everyone's opinion of the beastmen, and they decided to give the food to Gog instead of the beastmen.  They instructed everyone to leave the heavy scale armor in the secret door, grabbed the wheelbarrow of food, and headed south and east to the concealed door behind the baboon fresco.  They took the hidden stairs down to the Cave of Gog.

Gog heard them coming, and was waiting outside the secret door when it opened.  He was pleased to see the wheelbarrow of food and asked if it was for him.  Pleased to hear that he was, he got his boat and had them dump all the food from the wheelbarrow into it.  Gribble said that goblin territory was just to the south and asked if the party would like to meet his brother the king.  The other freed prisoners were not so enthusiastic about tromping through goblin territory, but they didn't want to go back to Gosterwick without their heavily armed escort either, so they came along.  Gribble led them south into a room full of many goblins, who enthusiastically greeted him.  Their leader led Gribble and his huge entourage east to Killik, the Boss of the Wet Caves.  Killik then appointed one of the other goblin captains Temporary Boss and went with Gribble down a long staircase to Goblintown.

Arriving in Goblintown, Killik and Gribble led the party through a confusing maze of passages.  At one point they were led across a rickety bridge "maybe not so strong for big people go one at a time."  Uvash actually broke one slat of the bridge when crossing it, but managed not to fall.  They eventually reached a room with ogre guards outside, where the goblin major-domo, Pelestrim, greeted Gribble and went into the room to arrange an audience.  A minute later, Gribble and his rescuers were invited in to meet King Weskenim.

King Weskenim asked Gribble a lot of questions in Goblin, then thanked his rescuers in accented Archontean, and said he wasn't prepared for their arrival but promised them a reward next time they visited.  He also mentioned the need to recover the Scepter of the Goblins.  When Vael asked if the goblins knew about any other entrances to the Halls, Weskenim said that was a sore point, that Plumthorn's Halflings were squatting on his rightful entrance to the surface, and needed to be removed.  After hearing how many Settites they had killed, he said the Right for Riches company were just the halfling exterminators he needed and to please take care of the infestation at their earliest convenience.  He warned them that the halflings had a wizard and used poison.  At some point during the meeting, Weskenim's cat jumped onto his shoulder, at which point the king had to end the meeting to play with the cat.

With the royal audience concluded, Killik led the party and their freed prisoners back up to the Wet Caves, this time taking a longer route that didn't involve any bridges that might not be strong enough for armored humans or dwarves.  At one point he rushed them past some kind of demon imprisoned in a summoning circle reciting obscure mathematical formulae, but didn't answer any questions.  They went back up to the Wet Caves, then back to Gog's Cave, where Gog was happily sorting his newly acquired food.  Gog ferried everyone across the underground stream in his boat, and they went upstairs, then out to the surface through the basement exit, then back to the Broken Head to get their mule, then back to the dam to stow their wheelbarrow, then finally back to Gosterwick.

In Gosterwick, Jador the Just at the Temple of Mitra was excited to see Lillian had been rescued, and detailed a lesser cleric to go with Ioannes to the Silent Factor and transfer the reward money to his account.  Anaximander, the ancient sage they had rescued previously, had been healed of his insanity, and was dictating the events of 250 years ago to some other clerics.  Vael asked for access to Anaximander, and Jador agreed to let him read the notes the clerics had compiled so far, and also personally visit him.  Lillian and Azgallatu said they would stay at the the Temple of Mitra for a few days before heading to Newmarket, while the other freed prisoners got rooms or bunkroom beds elsewhere in Gosterwick.


GM's Comments:

Another large battle, but not as large as last week.  Great Haste is still very good.  Grease is pretty good too.

I need to spend more time with the Foundry Token Attacher module so I can quickly make a train of NPCs follow a PC.

I was not really prepared for the PCs to go down to Goblintown (I should have been, since they were heading for Lillian and Gribble was in the next cell over, but I had wrongly assumed they would just let Gribble go rather than following him home) so had to scramble to find the right paths for everyone to take around the Goblintown map.  Since there wasn't a lot of time left in the session, I rushed through the first meeting with King Weskenim and had him invite them back for another one.


Achievements:

The Rescuers: for rescuing Susarra, Lillian, Gribble, Eadgithu, Geleg, and Grist.
Quest: for bringing Lillian back to the Temple of Mitra
Knockback: 1 XP to Uvash for the first hit with a blunt weapon hard enough to achieve knockback.  (This happened all the time in GURPS 3E, but is rarer in 4E and DFRPG due to some rules changes.)
XP:
Exploration: about 47 rooms (across 3 sessions) (many of them led through goblin territory), 2 XP
Loot: reward money, 2 giant rubies, coins and gems and weapons and armor: 2 XP
Achievements: 2 group achievements, 1 individual achievement for Uvash
Total: 7 XP for Uvash, 6 XP for Vael/Vallium/Ioannes, 4 XP for Michael (missed a session)

Next Week:

The PCs have a lot of options.  The obvious ones are to try to get their reward from King Weskenim, further battle the Cult of Set, or finally deal with Plumthorn's Halflings.  But they also have several parts of the Halls to explore.

DFRPG Bonus Downtime Recap: Strange Happenings in Gosterwick
There's this idea in DFRPG that Town is a "safe zone".  PCs can shop and train there and don't have to worry about being robbed or murdered.

Is that true in Gosterwick, 10 miles south of the ruins of Arden Vul?  Apparently not.

The Right for Riches company returned to Gosterwick after their successful mission to rescue Canon Lillian of the Church of Mitra from the dungeons of the Cult of Set. This mission incidentally resulted in the deaths of about a dozen Settites guarding the path to Lillian's cell, plus about a dozen more Settites in the nearby Temple of Set who just happened to be doing the wrong evil ritutal in the wrong place at the wrong time.  And a giant crocodile who took advantage of the chaos to try to eat an allied NPC.  While the PCs were in the Temple of Set, they also stole anything valuable looking that wasn't too heavy, including a couple of gigantic and incredibly valuable rubies from the largest cult statue's eyes.  And some of the PCs may or may not have urinated on a holy altar of Set; the stories are inconsistent.





(Artistic interpretation of Uvash and Ioannes stealing the ruby eyes of the cult statue in the Temple of Set, over the corpse of the giant crocodile Susarra killed, while Vael, Michael, Vallium, and an unidentified NPC discuss their next move.)
It appears that the Cult of Set was not happy about any of this.  A few days after the Right for Riches Company returned to Gosterwick, two things happened:

Coinbase, leader of the Grudge Brigade Mercenary Company, received an anonymous offer under his door.  It promised a payment of $2500 each for Vael, Vallium, Ioannes, Uvash, Michael, or Susarra, dead or alive.  They or their remains should be brought to the Duty Deacon in the [[locations/Forum of Set.md|Forum of Set]], who would then contact the Pontifex to verify the identify of the invader and pay the reward.  (Coinbase decided to sell the contract to Vael rather than acting on it.)
Susarra was decapitated in her bed at the Yellow Cloak Inn.  Her head and the more valuable and portable parts of her gear were missing.  Vallium, who the innkeeper had seen with Susarra, was called in to identify the body, and then Vael showed up and asked for a blood sample from the victim.  His request was initially denied by the guards at the crime scene, while one of them added Vael's name to A List.  Later that denial was overruled by Audun Yellow-Eyes, head of the Drome in Gosterwick, who sent a blood sample to Vael.
Once he got the blood sample, Vael cast Seeker followed by Trace, revealing that Susarra's head was currently in a backpack tossed in a corner of a comfortable room, about ten miles north of Gosterwick.  Vael could maintain the Trace spell as long as he could stay awake, but could not cast Seeker again for a week, so he advocated cutting short the usual week of downtime between delves and immediately going after whoever murdered Susarra.

To be continued...

After the murder of Susarra, the Right for Riches company decided to head back to Arden Vul before the Trace spell on her head wore off.  Knowing that he couldn't sleep without losing the Trace, Vael first went to the Temple of Mitra to see if any of the priests there could cast Vigil to let him go a night without sleep without ill effects.  Unfortunately, nobody there was able to cast Vigil.

The party then went to the House of Sight in Gosterwick where they were granted a meeting with the logothete, Audun Yellow-Eyes.  Audun explained that he was appalled by the murder of Susarra, but could not officially endorse an attack on Set, or lend any resources to one.  Also that if anyone asked about the vial of Susarra's blood sent to Vael, it wasn't him.

They continued to the Azure Keep to try to arrange a meeting with Lady Alexia.  Unfortunately, she was not available.  They did meet with her steward, Freydis the Stern, who gave her condolences on Susarra and said that she would pass along any inquiries to Lady Alexia when she returned.

With no help forthcoming, they headed out for Arden Vul just after sunset.  A few miles from the Cliff Face, they heard riders coming south down the Imperial Road toward their lights.  It was four Knights of the Azure Shield, who asked them to identify themselves, they had questions about Michael's red scale armor.  They were satisfied with the answer that the armor had come off a dead Settite and there hadn't been time to repaint it before the Settites killed their friend and required a late night attack.  The knights continued their patrol.

When they reached the Cliff Face, they saw lights halfway up the cliff, west of the waterfall, at the site of the Set cult's basket.  Vael Levitated up to try improve his triangulation on Susarra's head.  He was surprised to see that she was at the same elevation as the Set basket, and somewhere west, rather than up at the level of the ruins.  Vael flew back down to confer with the group.  They decided to go up to the ruins of Arden Vul, then back down though the basement, around the halflings, and through the desecrated Temple of Thoth to reach the Temple of Set.

Everyone (except Vael, who was still Levitating) tied themselves together for the night climb.  About halfway up the Long Stair, they encountered a beastman patrol heading down.  The beastmen formed up into a hedgehog formation as their sergeant asked the group to identify themselves.  He then indicated that his group would back up to a wider spot on the trail and allow the party distance to pass, as they were not looking for conflict.  This was agreed, and the Right for Riches company passed by the beastmen as they stood in defensive formation.  They continued to the top of the climb, then north across the ruins.

They group passed through the basement without encountering anything, then went down the spiral stair, west through the illusory wall, south through the destroyed remains of a one-way door.  They discussed going through the catacombs to stay farther from the halflings, but decided the secret door behind the Thoth statue was faster.  They were lucky enough not to meet any halflings, and went down the narrow secret passage west into the desecrated Temple of Thoth.  At that point they heard the blaring of a horn from the secret peephole high on the west wall -- their bright lights had been spotted.

The party quickly went south through a secret door, carefully picked their way through a formerly trapped room, and set off the gas trap again, which had been reset.  Nobody breathed any of the gas, though, and they continued south to the corner, then looked up west to see the barricade had been rebuilt and there were a mass of guards in red Set scale armor behind it, commanded by a sergeant, and accompanied by a goat.

The guards threw Alchemist's Fire flasks at Michael, Vallium, and Ioannes.  Michael was directly hit and set on fire, but he was wearing the Serpent's Amulet and didn't mind.  While the others hung back a bit, Michael started up the stairs.  Meanwhile Vael cast Shape Fire and started moving the rest of the boiling oil up the stairs toward the barricade.  Vallium went up the stairs behind the fire, warning the others not to stand directly behind him.  Uvash trailed Vallium off to one side, and Vael and Ioannes stayed well back.

As Vallium made himself a conspicuous target, he took several shots from crossbows.  He dodged several, trying not to give away that he had an an Amulet of Missile Shield.  Up against the barricade, Michael took a point-blank crossbow shot and failed to dodge it, resulting in a major wound to the chest.  He responded by stabbing the arbalester with his long sword.  The Vael-controlled fire wrecked the Settite line, as half the guards jumped to the sides to avoid the fire, and a couple failed to dodge it, caught on fire, and had to stop, drop, and roll to put it out.

Michael went over the barricade and stabbed a couple more guards.  Vallium followed him over and joined in.  Uvash and Ioannes came up behind, and Ioannes reached over the barricade to heal Michael twice, first with Stop Bleeding and then with Major Healing.  Vael stayed on the stairs and just sent his fire around the room harassing the guards, who occasionally failed to dodge and had to stop fighting for a bit to roll around on the ground.

Meanwhile Sparky the Goat decided to help his sept by charging into battle to slam the invaders with his horns.  Unfortunately for Sparky, Vallium and Michael had shields and heavy armor, so his slams were not enough to knock them over.  Worse, Sparky was not wearing armor, so when he got hit by the fire, the room smelled of burning goat.  After a bit of fire damage and a stray sword or mace shot, Sparky went down and did not get back up.

The Set sergeant recognized that his side was losing, and told one of his unwounded guards to run north to the temple and get reinforcements.  Vael responded by sending some of his fire after that guard to try to slow him down.  Eventually, the Settites lost 6 elite guards and a goat, while 2 guards and the sergeant managed to flee north.

As Uvash ate some singed goat, Vael checked his Trace and found that Susarra's head was down and west.  The Right for Riches company quickly regrouped to discuss their next move.  Did they chase north through the temple, or cut west and try to reach the stairs?  Taking a quick look through the burned curtains, they saw some cultists  fleeing west and a giant lizard chasing a boar.  Deciding to avoid that chaos, they went back into the room to the south and grabbed a couple of flasks of Alchemist's Fire and a couple of maces that Vael thought looked nice, plus a few silver coins from a chest.  After leaving some rude graffiti and setting a few cots on fire, they went west through the passages between the temple and the prison, trying to outflank the guards in the temple and reach the stairs down.

Unfortunately for them, the Settites had thought of this, and there was a large group of guards waiting on the wide stairs.  It was a dozen guards, four acolytes, and a couple of sergeants, including the one they had just been fighting.  About half the guards had crossbows ready, and one of the sergeants was yelling "nobody use fire."


Start of the battle on the wide stairs




Vallium, with his Amulet of Missile Shield, led the way, trying to draw more crossbow fire.  Michael followed behind, drawing his boomerang.  He threw it into the clump of guards, missing one near the front.  Unfortunately for the guards, it was a target-rich environment, and the boomerang missed or was dodged by two more guards, before it plunked one in the back who had no idea was was happening.  He fell down, momentarily stunned, and dropped his mace.

Four of the six guards with crossbows fired at Vallium.  He dodged all of the shots (some legitimately, some with magical help), before critically failing one Dodge roll and starting to fall down.  Realizing that he didn't want to be prone next to a pile of enemies, he used Luck to reroll the critical failure and avoid the fall.  The last two crossbowmen held their fire, as the sergeant said something about waiting for a better target.  The guards in the back with maces and shields ready started surging to the front.

Uvash prayed for his Heroic Grace and got a great result, +7 to DX for 13 turns.  He decided to use this temporary blessing to go for aimed shots at the skull and try to knock guards unconscious with one blow.  Meanwhile Michael and Vallium just went toe-to-toe with the front row of guards and started cutting them down, Vallium with single Deceptive Attacks, Michael with double Rapid Strikes.

Vael considered coming around the corner to help, but realized he'd probably get shot as soon as he did, so paused to cast Missile Shield on himself.  As soon as he emerged, the last two crossbowmen used their Wait maneuvers to drill him, and missed due to the spell.  After laughing at them, Vael cast Grease into the swarm of guards.  Meanwhile, two of the acolytes in the back were casting spells of their own: Dispel Magic, trying to take out whatever buffs the PCs had.  Both succeeded by slim margins, and failed to knock the Bless off any of the four PCs in the area of effect, as Ioannes outrolled them.  They also failed to dispel Vael's Trace.

Michael and Vallium continued cutting into the swarm, aided by the defense penalty for Grease.  Uvash meanwhile started smashing skulls, failing to one-shot kill any unwounded guards, but knocking a few unconscious.  Vael, seeing the acolytes in the back casting more spells, followed up his Grease with a Smoke, trying to mess up everyone's concentration.


Battle after Grease (right circle) and Smoke (left circle) were cast


At some point the remaining Settites started fleeing west down the stairs.  All the sergeants and acolytes and a couple of the guards got away, while Michael and Vallium and Uvash cut down the stragglers.

Vael checked his Trace and saw that Susarra's head was still down and west.  The Right for Riches Company started down the wide stairs after the Settites.  There were realistic busts of (mostly) older men flanking both sides of the stairs, probably Settite priests.  Uvash wanted to spend some time smashing them, but the others pressed him to hurry up and pursue.  As they continued down, the stairs bent left, from west to southwest and then south.  And the busts were replaced by some stuffed heads of various creatures: reptilian humanoids, one with horns, a bat, even a frost giant.  The frost giant head was enchanted, and started swearing in several languages (some the PCs knew, and some they didn't) as they approached.  Uvash put some leftover goat meat into its mouth to attempt to shut it up, but it didn't work.

As the stairs debouched into a wide Forum, the party saw a passage running east to a portcullis, with a couple of guys in leather armor behind it.  At the bottom of the stairs were a mass of guards, including the ones that just fled plus some more.  Beyond the guards was a huge statue of Set in Set animal form, with several slaves chained to it.  It appeared they may have finally reached the Forum of Set.

We paused there due to time.

GM's Comments:

As expected, the Settites reinforced the guard post in front of their temple.  Not well enough though.  The PCs decided to continue down the stairs rather than retreating to Gosterwick after the second battle, figuring they didn't have enough exploration or loot to earn any XP, and that they should do some more damage or make some more progress.

Crossbows don't combine well with maces and shields.  Crossbows do great damage if they hit, but they take two hands, and it takes forever to ready a shield.  Without a shield, an unbalanced mace is a much worse weapon, as it can't both attack and parry in the same turn.  The cult of Set might consider swapping some maces for spears, or some shields for bucklers.

Sparky tasted better than he fought.


Achievements:

The PCs caught just a glimpse of the Forum of Set at the end of the session.  They haven't actually entered it or seen most of it yet though.

XP:

None until they go back to town.  So far they have only visited a couple of new locations, grabbed a small amount of loot, and glimpsed the edge of the Forum of Set.

Next Week:

The Right for Riches Company appears to be invading the Forum of Set.  Do they smash a major faction of Arden Vul, or get swarmed and make new PCs?  I have no idea.

We resumed the battle with the Right for Riches company having chased the retreating Settites down the Sighing Stair into the Forum of Set.  At that point the party paused, because there was a portcullis on their left side and they were worried about being surrounded if they continued.  The Settites also paused at the bottom of the stairs, to form up and load crossbows.


Start of the battle


After aiming for a bit, the Settites loosed a volley of crossbow bolts.  Vallium was missed due to his Amulet of Missile Shield.  Vael was behind a wall to the west and out of line of sight, so didn't receive any shots.  Ioannes, Michael, and Uvash each dodged, blocked, or were missed by a couple of bolts.  The Settites dropped their crossbows and readied their melee weapons as they surged forward.

Meanwhile the Settites behind the portcullis to the east rang an alarm gong to summon more guards.  Not wanting to deal with assault from that direction, Vael cast Smoke on those guards, distracting them and wrecking their line of sight.  The one with the gong kept ringing it though.

Uvash used his Divine Grace, which gave him +7 to DX for 13 turns.  With only a short period with Super Dwarf available, the PCs surged forward to meet the mass of Settites at the bottom of the stairs.  Michael readied an Alchemist Fire potion and threw it at one of the Settites.  He missed, but there were so many that it landed in another Settite's hex behind the target, doing some splash damage.

The Right of Riches Company had their shields, while most of the Settite guards had dropped theirs to fire crossbows and had not had a chance to pick them back up, so the PCs were at an advantage.  They cut down a few guards, killing a couple and knocking a couple of others unconcious, but a bunch more approached from the south and southeast.  When things started getting a bit lopsided, Vael threw a Smoke south of the stairs to slow the reinforcements, but the Settites started coming up the stairs and flanked Michael.


The Smoke slows further reinforcements, but there are enough to surround Michael, as the other PCs start falling back.

While surrounded by several Settites, Michael fell down, and appeared doomed.  He managed to regain his feet, but was reeling from his wounds, so his Move and Dodge were reduced.  He was a bit far for Uvash or Ioannes to heal him.  As he tried running up the stairs toward his comrades, one of the Settite guards appeared to hit him cleanly in the back for serious damage -- but Michael's Bless spell averted the attack.  Vael dropped a Grease on the stairs, while caused many of the Settites to fall and others to move more slowly, while Michael's Ring of Free Action let him keep going.  Eventually Michael got close enough to Uvash and Ioannes that they were able to drop a Stop Bleeding and a Major Healing on him, healing him enough to get his full Move back.  At that point Michael was as fast as the Settites, and the other PCs were faster, so they were able to escape up the stairs, with a swarm of Settites in tow.

The Right for Riches Company made it to the top of the Sighing Stair, ran east through the Temple of Set, then south and east past the barricade, then north into the desecrated Temple of Thoth, then down the skinny secret passage to the east.  The faster PCs ran at full speed to buy themselves a few seconds.  Ioannes and Uvash both cast Lend Energy on Vael, who was ready to cast Magelock on the door as soon as Michael came through it.

Unfortunately, right as the lead PCs came out the secret door, Roskelly and several of his halfling toll collector thugs were standing right in that area, looking at the statue.  They immediately started talking about tolls and dungeoneering licenses and asking where the PCs came from, since they hadn't come down the stairs from the [[locations/Pyramid of Thoth.md|Pyramid of Thoth]].  Vael pulled out his Dungeoneering License pin and flashed it at Roskelly and said they were a little busy with pursuing Settites right now.  That caused the halflings to take a few steps back toward their territory.  Michael came running through the door, Vallium slammed it closed, and Vael cast Magelock on it.  As they heard the Settites start trying to break the door down, the PCs discussed whether to go north toward the stairs up to the basement, or south to the pyramid teleporter to the Well of Light.  They went toward the basement, and the halflings let them go.

Having not found significant loot or explored much new territory, the Right for Riches company decided to keep delving rather than heading back to towh.  Rather than going upstairs to the basement, they headed east to the bridge over the chasm, and back into the room with the baboon-headed Thoth statue.  Vallium dug through his notes looking for the statue arm settings that opened a door last time, while Vael tried Lockmaster on a locked door to the north.  The spell unexpectedly failed, but a second attempt was a critical success and unlocked the door.  After listening at the door, Vallium went north into a room with 3 sarcophagi.  He motioned the others to stay back, indicating that if there were any arrow traps he didn't want anyone getting hit.  He then pulled the lid off the nearest sarcophagus.  He got a glimpse at a (non-moving) mummy, as tons of sand started pouring out of the ceiling.  Vael and Ioannes, who had been just inside the room, hopped out.  Vallium ran for the exit, which took him about three seconds, through rapidly rising sand, but he made it without falling.  As they looked into the room from the corridor outside they saw that it was buried under many tons of sand.  Vael said they could come back another time with digging tools and digging spells, but for now they should try another way.

They went back into the room with the statue and manipulated its arms to a few different positions.  Two positions each caused a secret door to open and an ibis-headed Guardian of Thoth to emerge to attack them, but the fights were five on one and the Guardians were not that hard to defeat.  A third position caused a door leading east to unlock, and the group went down a passage.

They went past a room to the north with previously looted sarcophagi, then past a large room where Vael had previously defeated a statue by Levitating out of reach, then past a Continually Lit room with a fountain that had given Uvash donkey ears, before finding a new room to the north.  The room had frescoes on all the walls featuring the exploits of the Archontean folk hero Larel One-Eye, who both Vallium and Ioannes recognized.  There were also a cloak rack with several cloaks; a chest; a weapons rack with a variety of knives; a desk with a golden apple, a silver letter opener, and some letters; and a pedestal with a funerary urn on it.  Vael and Ioannes went around the room looking for magic, and found that several of the knives and a couple of the cloaks looked magical, as did the apple.  Vallium checked to see if any of the items looked like the ones on the walls, and a multi-colored cloak looked like Larel's cloak, while one of the knives looked like Larel's stiletto.  Ioannes thought the multi-colored cloak might be magical, while Vael was pretty sure it wasn't, but Vallium put it on and turned invisible.  That settled the debate.  Vael declared that something in the room was interfering with magic detection, and they should take everything.  The letters on the desk all claimed to be from Larel to three different women, and all used the exact same phrasing with only the name changed.  Vael Apportated the chest open and found some clothing; inside a stocking cap Ioannes found a sack.  He reached into the sack and pulled out a rock, and decided the sack was special.  The urn did not appear magical, and the party left that behind.  They searched under the desk and along all the walls, then continued east.

There were doors north and east.  Behind the north door were spiral stairs up.  Vallium decided to go up.  This led them to an area they'd found before, northeast of the Well of Light.  There they remembered a secret door that they had found (with magical assistance after performing the Litany of Light) but never opened.  Vael figured out how to open it, and they opened it to reveal stairs up, with Thothian frescoes.

At the top of the stairs was a a large and interesting room.  There were two rows of statues of Archontean heroes of the past, with a few of the statues missing.  There were also several old corpses in the room.  Iaonnes inspected the bodies and thought they had been violently killed by something strong.  The bodies contained some weapons and armor, a few coins, a couple of potions, and a scroll.  Vael looked everything over and detected a magic sling and a magic shield.  The group then started looking around the edges of the room.  There were eight shrines, but seven of them were closed off behind some kind of magical force fields.  The one that was open contained a book and a quill and some Mithric writing.  Everyone decided to leave the shrine alone for now and come back later.  There was also a large statue of Thoth in ibis-headed form, with some orange gas descending from its beak, and some Mithric writing about pneuma.  Vael said that he had some theories about the statue and the shrine but they should leave for now and come back later.

They went back down to the Well of Light level, then went west and south to the actual Well of Light without encountering any baboons, and Vael cast Flight on Vallium and Michael and Levitation on himself, and everyone flew up the Well, with Vallium and Michael carrying Ioannes and Uvash.  They walked south across the ruins of Arden Vul, climbed down the Cliff Face (with Ioannes using his Luck to avoid a careless fall) and hiked back to Gosterwick.  They met another patrol of Knights of the Azure Shield on the Imperial Road before reaching town, but the Knights just asked them for news of the Settites and let them pass.

For security, Vallium, Uvash, and Michael moved out of the Yellow Cloak Inn and moved into the Arcane Practitioners Club with Vael and Ioannes.  They resolved to treat Gosterwick as a dangerous place after Susarra's murder and try to watch each other's backs.  Vael started analyzing all the items they recovered, casting Analyze Magic multiple times per item in case the magic concealing effect interfered with it.  It appeared that Larel's Cloak, Larel's Sack, and Larel's Pin (the letter opener) were quite powerful items.

GM's Comments:

Superior numbers are good.  The Right for Riches Company appear to be better than Settites, but not better than dozens and dozens of Settites.

I was pretty sure Michael was toast when he was significantly separated from the rest of the party with a whole lot of Settites in between, but Bless and heavy armor and some lucky die rolls and Grease and the Ring of Free Action, plus some timely healing spells, saved him.

I thought it would be hilarious if the PCs took all of Larel's decoy items and missed the concealed good ones, but Ioannes rolled a critical success on a Per+Magery roll, and Vallium thought to correlate the items in the frescoes with the items in the room, and Vael then declared they should take everything in the room even if they didn't think it was magical (except the urn), so that didn't happen.

I think the players were more excited to find a new stairway up than they were to find unguarded magic items.

Achievements:
1 XP for reaching the Forum of Set, an Arden Vul Iconic Location

XP:
1 XP for exploration, for finding 10 new locations
1-2 XP for loot, depending on how much they sell
1 XP for an achievement 
3-4 XP total

Next Week:

They have a lot of options.  They can go after the Set Cult again, or deal with the halflings, or try to revisit the goblins, or explore more of the Halls of Thoth east of the chasm, or go back to the Hall of Shrines.  Or a half-dozen other places.  Arden Vul is big.

Wicktrimmer, the leader of the Rarities Factor in Gosterwick, sent a message to the Right for Riches Company that he believed they had found some significant magical items and he wanted to trade for them.  Vael, Vallium, and Ioannes met with him at the Rarities Factor.  Vael was curious how Wicktrimmer knew, and Wicktrimmer said he was a collector of magical items and regularly used magical means to detect any new powerful items in Gosterwick, but did not give details.

After a long negotiation, the Right for Riches Company contacted a local halfling lawyer, Barnaby Goodbarrel, and had him write up papers incorporating them as an officialy chartered company within Gosterwick, then get approval from the Thesmothete of Vetucaster, Eusbia Phokas.  With their Company legally able to own property, they returned to Wicktrimmer to conclude the deal.

He gave them 20000 pieces of silver, free lifetime banking at the Rarities Factor, personal shopping services in Narsileon (for up to five designated items per month, if available and found by his agent there, using their own funds deposited at the Rarities Factor), and any information on their enemies (particularly the Cult of Set) that he learned.  In exchange they would give him the powerful magic stiletto Larel's Pin and right of first refusal on any magical or historical items the company or its members wanted to sell in the future (except for a few items which Lady Alexia specifically claimed).

Wicktrimmer did not have any new information on the Set cult, beyond the contract on their heads that Coinbase had already told them about.  Vallium decided they should revisit the [[locations/Great Cavern.md|Great Cavern]] and see if the Settite guard post they had found there connected with the Forum of Set.  Vael's Living Wheelbarrow (invented by Ashe the goblin druid) was ready, so cast Levitation on it and used it to carry Larel's Sack.

Ioannes spent some of his wealth on an even more expensive power item, which enabled him to cast Bless +2 on Vael, Vallium, and Michael, as long as they paid for the power item recharges.  Uvash declined and kept his Bless +1.

The group left for Arden Vul early Tahsday morning (varying their delve day to throw off their enemies).  They first visited Yrtol's ruined watchtower.  Everyone gathered closely around Uvash and his Amulet of Bravery to resist Yrtol's fear effect, and Vael wore Larel's Cloak in hopes it would impress the ghost.  When they opened the trap door into the basement, Yrtol appeared and started talking about killing them and the rest of the Settites who'd sacrificed his Nyema.  Vael said something about killing many Settites themselves, which slowed Yrtol a bit.  Yrtol asked about Michael's red scale armor, and Vael said that it had come off a dead Settite.  At that point Yrtol decided to spare them, this time, but said not to come back until they'd killed 50 more Settites and recovered Nyema's body.  They asked how they would know her, and Yrtol said she'd had a wedding necklace with her name on it, in Mithric, if any of them could read.

Leaving Yrtol, the group headed north to the waterfall, up the Long Stair to the beastman secret door into the Great Cavern.  After going in, Vallium led them north to the statue of The Philosopher, where he put two magical silver eyes into its empty eye sockets to see what would happen.  The silver eyes disappeared but there was no obvious magical effect.  Vael cast Identify Spell and determined that the statue had just cast some kind of Great Healing spell over the area, but since none of them had been injured, it was wasted.

Next, Vallium lead the group east then north through side caverns until they reached the cave with 3 fire mephits and a column of magical fire.  He asked Michael, wearing the Salamander Amulet, to check out the fire and see if it led anywhere interesting.  It did not.  It nicely cleaned his armor, though.  The mephits were a bit grumpy, because they were out of Eye Opener mushrooms.  They asked the group to bring them some.

Next, the group went west across the Great Cavern toward the Set guard station, 25' up the western wall.  Vael cast The Bracteros Effect on Vallium's Continual Light stone so that nobody far away could see it, and the rest put their lights away.  As they got closer, Vael cast Walk on Air on Vallium, Michael, and Uvash, then used Larel's Cloak to turn himself invisible, then used the Ring of Friendly Defense to turn himself blind and make Vallium invisible.  Invisible Vallium then walked up the air to the Set guard post, where four Set guards were standing.  He backstabbed one of them from total surprise, badly wounding and stunning him.  The stunned guard fell off the tower and sustained near-fatal falling damage.  While the three remaining guards were still a bit surprised, Vallium started stabbing them, while both Michael and Uvash ran up and joined in.  The battle was quickly over, with 3 guards killed and the first one lying unconscious below the tower.  Vael rested to recover from all that spellcasting, while a couple of the others stood guard in case there were more Settites, and a couple killed the unconscious guard, stripped all the guards' weapons and armor, and threw them all in Larel's Sack.  They also found a couple of keys.

They went west into the cliff face, found the Settites' supply room full of sacks of food, and considered burning it but decided not to.  They then continued into the Settites guard rest room, which was unoccupied.  There was a locked door on the north wall, which one of the keys they just took opened.  This led north through a mix of finished passages and rough cave tunnels to another locked door, which led to a finished room with another locked door to the west, which led to stairs down.  This was what they'd been looking for, but they decided to explore more of the immediate area before trying the stairs.

They continued north and found a room full of zombies with axes and shields.  The zombies immediately attacked, through a narrow connecting tunnel.  A slow combat ensued, where the zombies failed to hurt the PCs, but dodged a lot of attacks.  Vael cast a Create Fire in the middle of the zombie swarm, and the zombies mostly just ignored it and slowly burned.  The combination of fire, two swords, and a mace eventually finished all the zombies.  There was a creepy magic black light in the room behind the zombies.  After a bit of examination, Vael smashed it.

Continuing north into another cave, the group saw a 3' tall magical statuette of a sitting golden cat with black gem eyes, surrounded by old corpses of 3 people and a lizard.  Ioannes looked at the corpses but failed to determine cause of death.  Vael started casting Analyze Magic on the statue, but then started hearing meows and hisses in his head.  A few minutes later, he started hearing an accented voice in his head, saying "Avenge this wrong!  Return me to my sister-people.  Touching is forbidden!" over and over.  He tried asking questions, but didn't get any answers.  Uvash and Ioannes thought the statue might be an icon of the Cat Goddess Bastet, but nobody knew of any nearby temples or worshippers of Bastet, so they decided to leave the statue.

To the southwest there was a passage with some kind of flickery force field at the end of it.  Vael tried throwing a rock at it, and it flickered harder.  Michael then attacked it with his sword, and the field failed and fizzled out.  The party went southwest into the room, then a few seconds later a large black pudding hidden on the ceiling dropped onto Ioannes and achieved surprise.  It quickly started smothering him.  Ioannes tried cutting his way out with his axe, while Vallium and Uvash tried bashing it from the outside with sword and mace, and Michael tried pulling the pudding off Ioannes.  Vael first tried some fire and then a wall of lightning to damage the pudding.  Ioannes was badly hurt and knocked unconscious, but the Bracers of Force he was wearing provided some full-body protection, and the combination of stabs and bashes and fire and lightning killed the pudding, as Michael pulled Ioannes out.  Uvash healed Ioannes, while Vael used Apportation to get a sample of the pudding into a glass vial.

After a few minutes to recover, the group searched for secret doors, then Vael cast Seek Earth looking for gold, and Seek Magic.  The nearest unknown gold and magic were to the east, so they went that way.  The magic turned out to be a cave full of some kind of shimmering opalescent fog.  Nobody was sure what it was, and nobody wanted to go into it, so they left that cave.  The gold seemed to be in the direction of a cave full of mushrooms and fungal foresters that they'd visited before.

As they reached mushroom cave, the fungal foresters started speaking a language that nobody recognized.  Ioannes cast Gift of Tongues on Vael to let him speak fungal forester.  The lead forester talked about how cool [[npcs/Ptarmis.md|Ptarmis]] was and how much he liked the living wheelbarrow and asked if they were friends of Ptarmis.  Vael indicated that they were also friends of Ptarmis and asked if the foresters had a source of cloud cap mushrooms.  The forester indicated that cloud caps were in short supply because the beastmen kept taking them, but might trade some for that wheelbarrow.  Vael said not today, but maybe next time.  He also cast Seek Earth again and found the gold was a bit northwest.  Searching the northwest wall for secret doors, they eventually found one, which the fungal foresters were apparently unaware of, as they were pretty excited when it opened.

The group crowded into a room, containing a big bubbling cauldron and 6 very skinny beastman troopers.  Vael again used Larel's Cloak to appear friendly and charismatic.  The beastmen asked if they were new recruits to Androsia and if they had any food.  Vael lied and said they were, and a couple of them gave their rations to the hungry beastmen.  At that point Vallium led the beastmen to the western part of the room and asked a lot of questions about marching and guarding and Androsia and the area, while Vael turned invisible and started looting the cave.  He found a magic bag, some gold solidi and ancient silver coins, some magic glass eyes on the wall, and a couple of potions on a shelf.  He threw the magic bag into the wheelbarrow and the rest of the stuff into Larel's Sack, then went back out the secret door.  After Vael left, Vallium said something about forgetting something to the southeast before they could return to take their guard shift, and the group left.  The fungal foresters were sniffing around the secret door, so Ioannes cast Gift of Tongues on Vael again, so he could explain that there were beastmen on the other side of the secret door who might be hungry and not friendly, so the foresters might want to keep it closed.

Leaving the fungus cave, the group went north a bit to try to finish their map, and found a room with several goblin-sized cave lizards.  Not looking for a fight, the group backed away.  At that point they went back south and west and decided to try the stairs down.  Vael used Larel's Clock to turn invisible, and the Bracteros Effect to hide his light, and went ahead of the group a bit to scout.  The stairs went down and west quite a bit, then the passage turned south.  To the south was an octagonal room with four exits, and a group of four varumani armed with mattocks were guarding all four exits in ambush position.  Vael turned around and went back to the group, indicating that there might be a serious fight if they continued.

At that point the Right for Riches company decided that they had their quota of dead Settites and loot for the day, and started heading back for Gosterwick.  Vael did some scouting by Levitation and found what looked like a small old Archontean temple atop one pillar of stone, but didn't get very close.  He saw Ptarmis sitting on his big stone throne, but didn't approach close enough to talk.  He also got another look at the big plateau on the eastern end of the Cavern with a weird metal pillar on top and a cave going down inside, but did not stop to investigate either.

The group made it back to Gosterwick, with another magic bag, a decent pile of gold and silver coins, a vile of black pudding, and the weapons and armor of four more Settite guards.  They had found the stairs down they were looking for.

GM's Comments:

Wicktrimmer really wanted Larel's items.  There was a pretty serious debate among the players as to whether to sell or trade any of them, but "We want Wicktrimmer as a friend and knives aren't great weapons and none of us really uses one" won out over "this is a rare and cool magic item so we should keep it just in case", so they sold Larel's Pin.  Larel's Sack and Larel's Cloak were more immediately and obviously useful, so none of the players considered selling them.  Amusingly, after 23 delves without a magic bag, they found magic bags on consecutive delves.  (Vael identified the new one as a regular Bag of Holding, but actually heavier and with a larger capacity than Larel's Sack.  We'll see if they keep both or sell one.)

The group didn't want to try another frontal assault on the Forum of Set in the direction the cult would expect, so they went looking for a back door instead, and found exactly what they were looking for.  However, they also found four varumani on the other side.  We'll see whether they go that way again, or try something else.

The black pudding got Ioannes to -5 HP, 6 away from a death check.  He still had a Bless spell, so he was guaranteed to make his first death check at -11 HP, but the one at -22 HP was no guarantee, and the pudding could have gotten him there quickly.  Fortunately for the PCs, a five on one numerical advantage is really good.  The pudding was pretty tough, and probably could have killed any one of them with surprise, but four of them combined to kill it pretty quickly.  (Michael didn't help kill it, as he was trying to pull it off Ioannes instead.  Which he managed to do, right as it died.)

Using Larel's Cloak (and some food) to get a friendly reaction from Androsia's beastmen, then turn invisible and loot the room they were guarding, was definitely some Larel-like behavior.

Achievements:

None

XP:
Explored 7 new locations, good for 1 XP
Found enough loot to easily get 1 XP each.  Maybe 2 XP if they sell the magic items.
Total 2-3 XP each

Next Week:

No game the next two weeks; GM on vacation.  We'd played every week since March, so this ends a good streak, but we'll start another one when I get back.

The Right for Riches company decided it was finally time to take down Plumthorn's extortionist halfling gang.  But they waited until the Lunday after the Voluptarian Days intercalary period to go back to Arden Vul.  Uvash was unexpectedly ill (some suspected a hangover after the harvest festivals, but that was also unusual for a dwarf), so they hired Lacrymosa the mercenary archer from the Grudge Brigade.

They woke up very early, with the goal of arriving at the base of the Cliff Face beneath the ruins of Arden Vul around dawn.  Vael Levitated himself and a Living Wheelbarrow containing a Bag of Holding up the cliff, while the others roped themselves together for safety and climbed the Long Stair.  As they walked north through the ruins of Arden Vul, a huge green shape flanked by a merely large green shape appeared overhead, then dropped down in front of them into the Forum of Arden Vul.  It was Craastonistorex the green dragon, and he was angry.  He informed them that Someone Had Messed With the Water Level Again, and that as Wardens of the Dam, it was their job to keep that from happening.  He also informed them that they were late with their tribute.  Vael apologized, said they'd fix the dam right away, and that they'd bring tribute next week.  Craastonistorex said that next week wasn't soon enough, and he needed a magic item now or he would eat one of them.  Lacrymosa set down a potion.  Craastonistorex appeared to consider eating her for such a paltry gift, but magnanimously let it slide, as Briar the wyvern picked up the potion in his claws.  The dragon repeated his instruction to fix the water level immediately, and flew away, flanked by his pet.

The group immediately headed for the dam.  They saw their lock was gone from the door.  Inside the dam, all the tools they had been storing were gone.  Vallium immediately used the dam controls to reset the water level to the dragon's preferred setting.  Meanwhile, Vael cast Seeker looking for the wheelbarrow they had kept in the dam, and saw that it was in Newmarket, about 30 miles to the South.  He then cast Trace to prepare to hunt down the thieves, but they realized 30 miles was a long walk and keeping the spell up that long was impractial, and let it lapse.  He finally used Shape Earth to close some of the dam's stonework over the door, so that nobody else could easily go in and manipulate the water level again.

Vallium led the group to the basement entrance southwest of the Pyramid of Thoth.  As they walked through the ruined basement, a giant tick (roughly the size of a large dog) attempted to surprise and eat Lacrymosa.  She saw it coming, didn't deign to waste any arrows on it, and called from help while running away.  Michael, nearby, pulled out his sword and chopped the vermin in half.  The group then continued north through the basement and down the spiral stairs.  Halfway down the spiral stairs to the Halls of Thoth, Vallium tripped over a tripwire, connected to some bells.  He did not fall, but the bells made a lot of noise.  The others stepped over the tripwire, but they were worried that whoever placed the tripwire was now alerted to their presence.

At the bottom of the stairs, Vael cast Keen Vision to reduce the chance of further surprise, and cast Bracteros Effect on his Continual Light rock so that nobody could see it from a distance.  He asked the others to put their lights away, and then moved up to the front next to Vallium to look for trouble.  The group continued south and east until they were near the cavern, then halted to discuss tactics.  After some discussion Vael borrowed Lacrymosa's Lion's Cloak to gain Infravision, cast Wizard Eye, cast Invisibility on it, and sent the invisible Wizard Eye down the chasm to investigate.  The Eye peeked into the first room full of halflings and saw three guards by the chasm and several other halflings within the room.  It continued south and peeked in the second room, spying Plumthorn, Blandveg, and three more guards.  It continued south further and found another chasm exit on the east side of the chasm, then a couple of rooms they had previously found even further south, then winked out of existence as Vael decided not to maintain the spell.

With the Wizard Eye confirming that Plumthorn and Blandveg were there, they finalized the plan.  Vallium would drink a Flight Potion, Vael would cast Flight on Michael and maintain Levitation on himself, Vael would cast Invisibility on all the others and use Larel's Cloak to make himself invisible, and Vallium and Michael would carry Ioannes and Lacrymosa across the chasm.  They would attempt to bypass the first room full of halflings and enter the room with Plumthorn and Blandveg, kill those leaders, and then induce the other halflings to surrender.  While the others discussed the plan, Lacrymosa drank a Strength Potion and an Agility Potion and cast a Concussion spell, holding the small magical stone.

The group flew invisibly and silently past the first group of halfings, and into the room with the leaders.  Lacrymosa threw the Concussion at the three halfling chasm guards, stunning two of them and knocking the third unconscious.  She then put an arrow into Blandveg's heart, killing him quickly.  Michael dropped her and flew toward Plumthorn, while Vallium dropped Ioannes and flew toward Plumthorn, leading with his shield.  Plumthorn was a bit slow to react, and took a shield to the face from Vallium, knocking him prone, then a hard sword blow, wounding him and causing him to move slowly.

As Michael flew in to help finish off Plumthorn, the halfling leader asked for a parley.  While the negotiations commenced, Lacrymosa brutally put arrows into the eyes of both stunned halflings, killing them.  She they saw two halfling guards behind the portcullis 40 yards to the west charging toward the battle, and shot both of them too, this time going for vitals instead of eyes.  Plumthorn asked a lot of questions, while Vallium asked for unconditional surrender in return for the lives of Plumthorn and his surviving followers.  Roskelly led his followers from the Glory of Thoth through the portcullis.


Shooting West toward the Portcullis



Vael, still invisible, attempted to intimidate Plumthorn by explaining that everyone else in the room was dead and the reinforcements to the west were also dead and any other reinforcements who appeared in the hall would also be dead and he had better surrender soon.  Possibly because of the effects of Larel's Cloak, this was very effective, and Plumthorn gave up and yelled to the others to surrender.  Roskelly decided to run rather than surrendering, and Lacrymosa didn't like that, and shot him many, many times, not stopping even after Roskelly was clearly very dead.  Nobody else ran after that.

Ioannes cast Stop Bleeding on Plumthorn to keep him from bleeding out, and then the group stripped all the halflings of all their armor, metal weapons, and valuables, allowing them to keep their clothes and very cheap weapons like clubs and slings.  Vael instructed Plumthorn to lead his survivors out of Arden Vul, all the way back to Newmarket, and never come back or they would be killed.  The halflings filed up the stairs, leaving behind a giant pile of smelly extra small leather armor, spears, shortswords, and knives.

Vael and Vallium went south to parley with the goblins on the other side of the barricade separating halfling and goblin territory.  They informed the goblins that all the halfling territory would become goblin territory, and to send a messenger to King Weskenim.  The goblin sergeant, Bottleneck, was very excited by this news, and sent one of his warriors running down the tunnel to the Wet Caves.

Vael re-cast Keen Vision and went through all the halfling rooms.  In one sarcophagus, he found a secret compartment that the halflings seemed to have missed, with some treasure inside.  He used one of Plumthorn's keys to open Plumthorn's chest and found some more loot.  He found one wall that looked like new construction, but didn't find any secret doors in it.  Finally, Vael went to the approximate center of the halfling territory and cast Seek Earth for both platinum and gold, and Seek Magic.  All three spells pointed the same way, around 30 yards southeast, which did not correspond to a known room, so they noted that as a place to search for later.

The group then went west into the Glory of Thoth and searched the unexplored rooms that directly connected to it.  One led to a false door that opened a pit trap, but Vael had Levitation on and Vallium was quick enough to grab the edge of the pit as he fell, so nobody was hurt.  Another room was full of trash, and they decided not to spend much time searching it, since the Seek Earth and Seek Magic hadn't found anything there.  A third room contined both a Thothian teleportation circle and a magical bust floating in the air.  The bust could not be moved or taken, and did not respond to conversation, so they left it for now.

As the party finished their searches, the goblin sergeant Bottleneck came back up to the barricade.  He said his messenger had informed Killik, the Big Boss of the Wet Caves, who had gone to see King Weskenim, but they had not heard back from the King yet.  Vael advised that the goblins could take their new territory but should not go west of the Glory of Thoth because there were Settites there.  The group then followed a goblin guide down to the Wet Caves, then down to Goblintown.  The goblin led them over a frail bridge (none of the big people broke through), and over to the Goblin Court.  Killik was there, waiting for King Weskenim to come out of his harem.

A few minutes later, the King emerged from the harem room, spoke to Killik, went into his audience room, spoke to his advisors, then invited the Right for Riches company in.  He informed them that he was very happy that the rightful goblin territory had been restored, and rewarded them with a large perfect diamond.  He also said that he still owed them a reward for freeing his brother Gribble from Set prison, and pointed at a human-sized set of magical scale armor on display.  It was the armor of a huge ancient goblin king, but it was too big for Weskenim, so he was awarding it to them.

At that point Vael started negotiating with the king.  He would happily present the former halfling territory to the goblins, but wanted free passage through goblin territory.  The king agreed, but said that some goblin territory was dangerous so they should get an escort.  Vallium asked about Gislu and the Scepter of the Goblins.  The king said that Gislu was some kind of fake mystic and the Scepter seemed like a ploy to steal power, and it might not exist, but if it did exist, it was the rightful property of the king and he would reward them for finding it.  They also asked about the Regalia that the Green Lady was looking for, but the goblin king didn't know anything about that.  Weskenim also noted that he had a guest room that was currently occupied by a Sun-Scarred Knight, but that if the occupants moved on, the Right for Riches company would be welcome to use it.  In the meantime they would be welcome to visit the Goblin Great Hall for shopping and dining.  Vael also asked about the Troll Lifts, and the king said they were east of the goblin territory in the Wet Caves and Killick could point out the way.  And also that the trolls preferred to be called varumani.

The group asked if they could meet the Knight, so an escort took them to the guest room nearby.  The door was opened by a large angry woman with magical armor and an axe, who didn't appear to want visitors.  She was overruled by her superior, Sir Sorrow, an equally large but less angry woman who invited the company into the guest room.  She was wearing amazingly heavy armor of a type the group had never seen, plates like a giant lobster which looked like they were probably impervious to harm.  A long discussion ensued, about who the Sun-Scarred Knights were, their role in preserving the peace within the Halls, what the elimination of the halflings meant, what the attacks on the Setties could do, the leader of the Knights, where they could get some armor like that, etc.

At the conclusion of the conversation, the company said farewell to Sir Sorrow, and were led by a random goblin guide east then north past Rizzit the imprisoned creepy purple wax demon (who asked to be freed) then down a spiral staircase then into the Goblin Great Hall.  This was a huge cave filled with many goblins, quite a few goats, and probably some other creatures.  There was also a huge bonfire in the middle, which some goblins were using for cooking.  There were several merchants set up behind tables in the southeast corner, so the group went that way for some shopping.

The first merchant was an Archontean woman selling weapons and armor, but nobody saw anything magical, so they kept walking.  The second merchant was an angry Wiskin guy selling food and drink, but nobody was hungry. The third merchant was a halfling named Master Leifcrim selling curios, and a couple of them looked magical, so they stopped to shop.  He ended up selling them another Returning Pebble (and explained that if a proper sales contract was written out, the magic of the pebble somehow knew that it had a new owner and would return to them), another magic fish-shaped rod of unknown use (but probably something to do with boats), and a small non-magical orange oval object made of a strange substance (it felt kind of like insect chitin) with strange glyphs and no known use.  They weren't sure they wanted the orange thing, but Leifcrim hinted that he had some really good magical items for really rich good customers, so they paid full price for the orange thing hoping that would lead to good deals in the future.

At that point, it was time to go back to Gosterwick, so the Right for Riches Company took their wheelbarrow and magical bags full of halfling loot and headed back up the stairs, then up the slope to the Glory of Thoth, then up the stairs to the surface and down the cliff.  They did not see Plumthorn or his followers on the way.


GM's Comments:

They finally got around to taking out the halflings.  It would have been a hard battle if it had happened months ago.  At this point, with the combination of a good ambush plan, flight and invisibility magic, and Lacrymosa (enhanced to superhuman strength and dexterity with potions and also using a Bless spell) shooting everything that moved, it wasn't very hard at all.  Plumthorn tried to negotiate, from a position of weakness, until Vael's critical success on an Intimidation roll showed him that he would be very dead very soon if he didn't give up immediately.

King Weskenim was happy to be gifted the halfling territory and rewarded them with free passage, loot, information, and an introduction to Sir Sorrow.  Sir Sorrow told them a bit about her order, the Sun-Scarred Knights, and the balance between factions in the Halls.

Achievements:

Quest bonus: 1 XP for eliminating Plumthorn's Halflings
Iconic location bonus: 1 XP for reaching the Court of the Goblin King and the Great Hall of the Goblins

XP:
Exploration: 6 new locations, good for 1 XP
Loot: 2 XP (diamond, whole bunch of halfling stuff)
Achivements: 2 XP
Total: 5 XP

Next Week:

With the halflings eliminated, the Right for Riches company needs to pick a new goal.  Do they explore more of the former halfling territory, explore more of Goblintown proper, go looking for the Troll Lifts, or resume their war against the Cult of Set?  I have no idea.

DFRPG Arden Vul Session 27: The Tomb of Ptoh-Ristus
Date: 
Mitrasday, 10th of Besemios, 2993 AE 


Weather: 

Cool, dry


Player Characters: 

Vael Sunshadow, Half-Elven mage (Kyle)
Vallium Halcyon, Archontean fighter (Greybrown)
Ioannes Grammatikos Byzantios, Archontean cleric of Demma (Demented Avenger)
Uvash Edzuson, Dwarven cleric of Zodarrim (Cosmo)
Sister Valya "Basilisk" Hushbreaker, Halfling mercenary monk (ArchonShiva)


Significant NPCs:

Vivian, priest of Demma
Wicktrimmer, Imperial Goblin banker and trader
Sanguinette, Basilisk's bat familiar
8 Set cultists
Bottleneck, goblin sergeant
Lots and lots of goblins
4 huge spiders
2 animated spearman constructs
2 mummies


Uvash, Vael, and Ioannes were all very sick.  Ioannes had no idea what it was but suspected something magical, so they went to the Temple of Demma, where the head priest Vivian diagnosed them with a magical curse and cast a Remove Curse spell on each of them, in exchange for a suitable donation to feed the poor.  They were never quite sure where the curse came from, but the spell seemed to fix it.  They grumbled about the cost anyway.

Vael went to visit Wicktrimmer at the Rarities Factor, found out that there was no news on their shopping list in Narsileon, and discussed whether Wicktrimmer would be willing to take over running the Forum of Set if the Right for Riches company successfully destroyed the Settites.  Wicktrimmer was non-committal.

Trying to keep their delve dates and times unpredictable, the Right for Riches company left at midnight on Demmasday.  Uvash wasn't happy about having to get up in the middle of the night.  The lights were shining in the entrance to the Set level, so Vael turned invisible and Levitated up to spy on the Settites, with Basilisk climbing the wall nearby and Basilisk's bat familiar Sanguinette flying beside.  The Settites charged with raising and lowering the basket were out of sight from outside.  Then some red-robed Set cultists started waving lanterns and torches below, and the Settites at the top lowered the basket and hoisted 4 of them up.  After a brief whispered discussion with Vael, Basilisk cut the rope, and the basket and its four cultists fell a very long way and smashed into the ground below.  The remaining cultists who had been waiting for their turn in the basket ran away, but the Right for Riches company chased them down and killed them.

With their daily quota of Settites eliminated, the PCs crossed over the Swift River at the northern bridge, then climbed up the Long Stair toward the ruins of Arden Vul.  They left a Hand of Glory (an evil Settite magic item they didn't think they could safely use) on top of the dam as tribute to Craas the green dragon, then headed for the Pyramid of Thoth.  They manipulated the statue arms to open the trap door to the safer set of stairs down, and went down into the pyramid.  At the first large landing below they met a guard party of goblins, who said this was now goblin territory.  Vael said something about how they were the Right for Riches company and were allowed, and the goblin sergeant checked his notes and said they were indeed expected and should check in with Master Sergeant Bottleneck near the Glory of Weskenim.

When they reached the bottom of the stairs, there was a closed door with a little window in it, and a goblin guard watching through the window.  After they announced themselves, the guard went to get Bottleneck, who let them in.  He seemed happy to see them, and gave Vael, Vallium, and Ioannes similar embroidered patches featuring a goblin impaling a halfling, commemorating the liberation of Upper Goblintown from the evil halflings.  (Uvash and Basilisk didn't get patches.)  Bottleneck pointed around the new goblin territory, warned the PCs about a couple of pit traps and the dangers of wandering zombies and Settites to the west, and said they were welcome to visit anytime.  He asked them to tell any other surface dwellers who wanted to visit the new goblin territory to bring booze.

Vael suggested a slight detour to the southwest to the small inside pyramid, because Vael wanted to cast Seeker to see if he could find the teleport control lever for the other pyramid on the Well of Light level, and figured that doing so while looking at an identical lever would improve his odds.  Sure enough, he got a vision of a lever sitting at the bottom of a wet pit, next to some kind of slimy monster, in the room with the Ruby Chair.  The group briefly discussed going after that lever, but decided that finding treasure in the new goblin territory was more urgent, in case the goblins found it first.

They went east, through the gray smelly mist, past the disgusting pool that the goblin guards called their new swimming pool, through a couple of secret passages, and into a room full of pillars.  They went east to where there were two adjacent doors that both led to known traps.  They opened the eastern door, which they knew led to a pit trap.  Vallium spiked it open, worried about self-closing doors.  They avoided the known pit trap, went to the end of the hall, tried to open a false door, and opened the known pit plus three previously unknown ones.  They were somewhat prepared for this, with Vallium secured to Uvash by a rope and Vael Levitating, so nobody actually fell in.  After verifying that none of the pits had anything useful inside and that the door was actually false, they went back out.

From there Vallium led them east toward the room of Prior Jacobus, which he said they'd never searched for treasure since helping Jacobus's ghost to his final rest.  Sure enough, when they found the room they found some very small orange Thothian robes, a key, a ring, and a couple of maps.  Vallium led the others through the rest of Jacobus's area, but they didn't find any other treasure.

Vael then cast Walk on Air on everyone, and everyone flew back across the Great Chasm to the west and searched the rooms there.  They found a magic stone chair again, but didn't sit in it.  They found a porch overlooking the chasm, with some abandoned rope and spikes.  There were also some stairs down, which they didn't take, but while they were searching the area, some huge spiders dropped from above and tried to eat Vallium.  Unfortunately for the spiders, his scale armor was stronger than their teeth, and he quickly recovered from surprise and killed all of them.

Going south from the porch, Ioannes found a secret door, and Vallium went through it and fell in a pit trap.  It hurt a bit, but his armor cushioned the fall.  The pit was full of a bunch of corpses and their equipment, so Vallium started looting, and Vael flew in to help identify the treasure.  The pit closed over their head before they were done, but they yelled up to have the others re-open it, then came out.

Continuing west, they found another secret door, leading them back to the giant stone chair overlooking the Chasm that Ioannes had previously sat in.  This time they avoided the chair and Vael cast more Walk on Air spells to help everyone fly up the chasm.  The spotted a room on the far side with another, much bigger stone chair.  That room had a large stela on the floor, featuring a carving of some kind of large biped with horns, surrounded by some glyphs in a totally unknown language.  Vael thought the language looked similar to the one on the orange oval object he had purchased in the goblin market.  They decided not to explore that room or its exits and went back to the Chasm.

Continuing north and west up the Chasm, they spotted a narrow passage heading east that Vael's Wizard Eye had spotted last week, but didn't follow it.  They then found a secret door on the west wall, in the area where they were hoping for treasure based on Seek Earth and Seek Magic castings.  Everyone went into the short secret passage, and Ioannes found a second secret door, into a room with treasure piled on the floor.  Vael opened it, and a needle trap failed to poke through his armor.  There was a big chest full of ancient coins, a matched pair of magic rugs, a bunch of alabaster vases and a silver ibis and a golden feather, a cleric scroll with a previously unknown and powerful spell to raise the sanctity level of an area, and a book in an unknown language.  They shoveled all the treasure into their magic bags.

A dead end passage south looked like an obvious place for another secret door, but there was no obvious way to open it.  Everyone looked, and then Vael tried a Lockmaster spell, but nothing worked.  Uvash suggested a pickaxe, but that seemed like too much effort so Vael used a Shape Earth spell.  That opened a hole into a larger room, containing two normal-sized white marble sargophagi and a huge black basalt sarcophagus.  There were also a couple of man-sized statues of spearmen.  When Vallium went into the room, the statues animated and charged.

A short fight ensued, where Vallium stabbed the statues while Basilisk glided down from the ceiling while attempting to stun them with kiai yells.  Once both constructs were smashed, the group continued into the room to look at the large sarcophagus.  It had a Mithric inscription saying “Ptoh-Ristus, Servant of the Lord Thoth, Knower of Secrets and Founder of these Halls”.  Vallium removed the lid, at which point the lids of the other two sarcophagi popped off and two mummies came out.

There were then two somewhat separate fights, with Vallium and Vael fighting the southern mummy and Uvash and Ioannes fighting the northern one, with Basilisk gliding around and yelling kiai at whichever one was closer.  One of the mummies hit Uvash pretty hard once, then knocked his Bless spell off with another punch.  Vael cast Great Haste on Vallium, who finished off one mummy then ran across the room to help with the other one.  Eventually Vallium downed it, while Uvash and Ioannes cautiously defended themselves.

The large sarcophagus contained another mummy, this one inert, with a magical golden death mask.  It also held some coins and some doll-sized furniture, including a tiny magic chair.  The group took everything that looked valuable, but Vael was suspicious they might be missing something, so used a charge from the Wand of See Secrets.  This didn't find any more treasure, but it showed a secret door in the southeast of the room, a huge falling stone block trap inside the secret door, and a bunch of poison dart traps along two walls.  Vael avoided touching any of the trapped areas and used magic to open the secret door, then Levitated down the secret passage to finish mapping the area.  It led back to an area he already knew, so he returned to the group.

With a decent amount of treasure found and everyone feeling tired, the group rested a bit, then Vael cast Walk on Air on everyone again.  They continued north up the Chasm until they reached a goblin-occupied room, where they greeted the goblin guards then walked over to the Glory of Thoth and up the stairs to the Pyramid of Thoth.  They then headed back to Gosterwick.

GM's Comments:

The players knew (due to knowledge magic) there was gold, platinum, and magic in the area southeast of the former halfling territory, but not exactly where, but they did a pretty good job of staying on target and using their map to search for secret doors until they found it.  They actually found the "back door" from the chasm to the Tomb; the "front door" that they didn't find until the end was actually much more dangerous as it had the worst traps, including the 10'x10'x10' stone block of "if this lands on you, you are just dead.  We don't need to roll the damage."

Two of the magic items they found in the tomb were very interesting.  The pair of magic rugs were Rugs of Instant Access, which allow teleportation from one to the other.  This seemed very useful, but they weren't sure about the exact limits yet.  The Death Mask of Ptoh-Ristus had a bunch of useful powers (Infravision, See Secrets, Will bonus, bonus to detect lies and illusions), but also some remaining magic that appeared very difficult to identify, as Vael and Lyssanra and Pelteon all failed.  We'll see if the Right for Riches company sells these items or keeps them for use.

Achievements:

None

XP:
Exploration: 6 new locations, good for 1 XP
Loot: Looks like 1 XP if they don't sell the good magic items, 2 XP if they do
Achievements: 0 XP
Total:  Probably 2 XP

Skalla, skeleton warrior

The Plan:

Vallium's plan for the week was to trade with the cave people to the west of the waterfall below Arden Vul, see if the Rugs of Instant Access had enough range to bypass climbing the Long Stair, clear out the pits near the Ruby Chair and find the control rod for the indoor pyramid teleporter, test the indoor pyramid teleporter, perform the Litany of Light again, talk to Yamki and Stamelis, donate a lot of alcohol to the goblins, and explore more of the Well of Light or Halls of Thoth levels.

What Actually Happened:

Vael got a tip from Creon the pawnbroker than an interesting item was available, and it turned out to be the Eyes of Set, some goggles that allegedly allowed seeing through magical darkness cast by Settites.  Vael purchased them.

Vallium went to Theopilos to have copies of Plumthorn's keys made for the goblins.  He also went to Egill at the Baliff's Truncheon tavern and purchased several barrels of moonshine for the goblins.  He also bought several axes for trade with the cave people.

Wicktrimmer sent the Right for Riches Company a note that he had information about their shopping list.  Vallium, Vael, and Uvash showed up at the Rarities Factor, where Wicktrimmer told them that his agents in Narsileon had found a magic broadsword that Vallium might like and some magic scale armor that might meet Michael's requirements, but that neither Bracers of Force nor any giant spider silk had been found.  Vallium and Vael (speaking for Michael, who was off in the woods somewhere on another hunting trip) approved the purchases, which Wicktrimmer said should arrive via mule train in a few weeks.

Wicktrimmer then said that His Sources had revealed the presence of strong teleportation magic in Gosterwick, and asked if they knew anything about that.  Vael admitted the existence of the teleportation rugs but said they hadn't told Wicktrimmer because they were still testing how well they worked.  Wicktrimmer asked for a description of the rugs, and said they sounded like Rugs of Instant Access, which Sligo the Devious famously used to assassinate Leonidas of Archontos.  He asked for an update after the rugs were tested, and said that if they had enough range to teleport someone from Gosterwick to Narsileon, he would pay a whole lot of money for them.

Trying to avoid being predictable, someone rolled a 7-sided die to figure out the day of their next delve.  It came up Tahsday, so very early Tahsday morning they set out for the caves west of the Swift River.  There were several cavemen standing guard outside their cave, They called into the cave for reinforcements, and a couple dozen more people came out.  Nobody shared a common language or had language magic, but Vallium gestured a desire to trade, and pulled 5 good quality metal axes out of Larel's Sack.  The cave people were impressed by the axes, and their older female leader (who turned out to be named Grugga) sent someone back into the cave to get something.  A few minutes later he emerged carrying a metal axe head, and being yelled at by a women who apparently didn't want him to trade the axe head.  Vael saw that the axe head was magical, and so told Vallium that trading 5 whole axes for that one axe head was a good deal.  The trade was made, and then the Right for Riches company tried gesturing back and forth with the cave people for a while but gained no significant information (beyond the gestured version of "snake people basket fall down go boom", which they already knew because they had been the ones to make the basket fall down), before leaving.

They walked a bit into the woods and spread out one Rug of Instant Access across the ground, then Vael cast Levitation and flew to the top of the cliff, holding the other Rug.  Vael spread out his Rug across the ground at the top, then stepped on it and said the command word "viator", and appeared on the other Rug near the others.  The others then used the lower Rug to teleport to the upper Rug, one at a time.  Finally Vael grabbed the lower Rug and flew up to the top of the cliff with the others.  The total time for two flights up the cliff was about six minutes, compared to well over an hour to climb the Long Stair (depending on climbing skill, load carried, and risks taken), so everyone agreed this was a success.

The group walked north through the ruins of Arden Vul to the top of the Well of Light.  Vael dropped a Continual Light rock down the Well and didn't see a bright reflection at the bottom, which indicated that the bottom mirror had probably been covered.  He Levitated down the shaft carrying one Rug, saw that the fixed mirror was indeed covered in muck and the portable mirror and stand were gone, but didn't see anything dangerous in the area.  He landed, spread out the Rug, teleported through it, sent the other 3 through the top Rug, then grabbed the top Rug and flew down the Well again to rejoin the others.  They spent several minutes cleaning baboon feces off the fixed mirror, then went south to visit the head of Stamelis in the Library of Thoth.

Stamelis seemed happy to see them, but didn't have a lot of news.  Nothing had come into the locked Library, though he had heard some baboons hooting.  He was annoyed that he had a whole library of books to read but no ability to fetch books or turn pages, and requested that the group find a nice priest of Thoth to assist him.

Everyone headed north to the [[locations/Hall of Judgment.md|Hall of Judgment]].  They pushed studs on the Ruby Chair until both pits opened.  One still contained 2 crocodiles, though they weren't moving much, possibly due to hunger.  The other contained some kind of creature with tentacles, and that was the pit that Vael's Seeker spell had said the pyramid control lever was in.  The tentacles weren't long enough to reach the top of the pit, so Vael decided to un-sportingly use Wall of Lightning in the water-filled pit to electrocute the monster from afar.  This worked, and after a while the whole room smelled of an unholy combination of wet dog and burned fish.  Vael rested for a while, then Vallium tied a long rope around the punishment pillar, and Vael levitated down into the pit while Uvash climbed down the rope to guard him.  Vael spotted the control rod for the pyramid and a magic wand and grabbed both.

The group discussed whether they should also kill the crocodiles, and then thought there might be treasure in that pit too, so they had to.  Vael repeated the remote electrocution trick.  This time Vallium went into the pit with Vael, because he wanted to try using his survival skills to try to extract valuable crocodile skin, and also see if there was anything valuable in their stomachs.  He failed to skin them cleanly, destroying the hides.  He also didn't find anything valuable inside them.  He did, however, make a giant stinky mess.  Meanwhile Vallium picked up a few silver coins.  The missing mirror was also in the pit, along with its stand, which was broken into two parts but looked fixable.  Vallium loaded the heavy mirror into the Living Wheelbarrow and Levitated it up.

With both pits cleared, the group turned their attention to the Ruby Chair.  Both dwarves agreed it sure looked like it was carved from one giant hunk of ruby, but that was impossible as rubies didn't get that big.  Vael cast Seek Earth for ruby, and it pointed right at the chair.  Thronebreaker tried using his considerable strength to move the chair, but it didn't move.  There was a Mithric inscription behind the chair that said “Speak the Secret Name and Claim Thy Reward.”  Vael read the inscription out loud, which did nothing.  He didn't know any secret name, but they thought Stemelis might, so they went back to the library to talk to him.  Stamelis didn't tell them any secret names.  Vael started looking through the books hoping one would have the secret name, but most of the books in the Thoth section were written in the Secret Language of Thoth, which Stamelis would not teach him because Thoth's Secrets Are For Thoth's Children.  After various attempts to trick, fast-talk, or persuade Stamelis, they left again.

Wanting to test the pyramid control rod, the Right for Riches company went west to the indoor pyramid, where Vallium installed the rod.  They then flipped the rod and appeared on top of the nearly identical pyramid one level down.  They they moved the matching rod there, and were back on the Well of Light level.

The group headed east toward the Howling Caves, and found Yamki the Three-Armed in a room just north of the portcullis leading to the Caves.  At that point there were some pointed questions about how the mirror got re-pooped.  Yamki said he didn't do it and his loyal baboons didn't do it but there might be some renegade baboons who didn't respect his authority and management was hard.  Vallium offered Yamki a bunch of meat in exchange for leaving the mirror alone and telling them who had vandalized it.  Yamki wasn't sure exactly who, but said that Trefko the old four-armed baboon, and several female baboons who had formerly been Sisko's harem, were still living to the west of the Hall of Judgment, and didn't listen to him.  The group headed that way to talk to the other baboons.

They went north past the Ruby Chair, the west past a trap door up with a rope hanging out of it, which they had seen before but hadn't explored.  They declined to explore it again and went south.  Eventually they listened at a door and heard loud snores behind it.  Opening the door found Trefko stumbling to his feet.  Trefko said that he hadn't been the one pooping on the mirror, but he didn't want to live in the Howling Caves because there were too many young baboons there and they were too loud.  He would stay in his room.  He agreed to not cause any trouble with the mirrors, in exchange for meat.  He also wanted a contract that said he was in charge of all the baboons, but Vallium said that was impractical and they had to work that out among themselves.  Uvash and Thronebreaker noticed that Trefko was wearing a Dwarven Life Stone around his neck, and asked whether he'd be willing to trade it.  He said that might be possible, for gems or large quantities of meat.  Vallium said they'd bring him a whole live goat next time.

Heading south, the group found the room with Sisko's former harem, which consisted of 4 baboons and 2 goblins.  They had a human male prisoner manacled to the ceiling.  These baboons couldn't talk, but the goblins could, and said they considered themselves part of the baboon tribe and didn't need rescuing, and also that King Weskenim sucked.  Also that Sisko was the king of the baboon tribe, so with his death they were the reigning queens, and they could poop wherever they wanted as this was their territory.  Vael went with diplomacy trying to talk sense into them to avoid violence, while Thronebreaker went with intimidation and ripped the prisoner's chains apart.  With the harem somewhat cowed by this display of brute force, Vallium told them that they had given Yamki a bunch of food to avoid further vandalism of the mirror, and that if the harem wanted some of it they should go over there to get it.  Once they left, Uvash healed the prisoner, a Thorcin warrior named Burris.  Vael levitated up to search two sacks hanging from the ceiling, and it turned out one was full of coins and the other full of miscellaneous treasure.  All of that went into the Bag of Holding.  Someone felt a bit bad for taking all the stuff, and suggested leaving some of the booze that was intended for the goblins in exchange.

Vael searched for secret doors, and found one on the east wall.  It was very hard to figure out how to open it, but a critical success on a Lockmaster spell did it.  Beyond the secret door was a narrow cobwebby corridor that looked like it had been unused for centuries.  Everyone explored it and found a tunnel heading east and a suspicious dead end to the north.  The dead end found another secret door, near the Ruby Chair, so once they opened that one to confirm they had a safe exit, they closed the first one so the harem wouldn't know about the secret passage.  Everyone then took the tunnel east.  Thronebreaker lent Burris an axe, just in case.

The tunnel led to a rough cavern, with an old corpse and some ancient rotted food.  There were dead end passages northeast and southeast.  The one northeast led to a secret door, which Thronebreaker opened.  That led to a room with a sarcophagus, but before anyone could explore it, three mantari (small flying ray-shaped creatures with stingers) ambushed Thronebreaker.  One of them actually hit and slightly wounded him, and then he and Vallium killed one and scared the other two into flying away.  The sarcophagus was empty, but there was a bridge over the Great Chasm (which was pretty narrow here) further east.

Crossing the bridge led to a room with a bunch of funerary gisants and some rotted crates.  After a bit of poking around, a ghost appeared and did not attack.  She revealed that she was Ptirasa, a priestess of Thoth, and warned the others that Arpostas was a traitor.  They had no idea who Arpostas was, though.  She also revealed that there were some nasty bugs in the crates and they should stay away from them.  Vael used Create Fire to keep the bugs away, and then the group found a secret door to the east, leading to a north-south passage they'd found before.

With exploration to the east complete, they doubled back to the west and explored more secret passages.  They eventually found a room with a pile of baboon skeletons on the floor, along with one human skeleton with an apparently magical axe, and a female elf skeleton on a bed.  Someone tried to take the axe, and the human skeleton predictably stood up and fought them.  However, it was four on one, and when the skeleton turned to face Vallium, Thronebreaker got behind it and did a Power Blow plus Rapid Strike from behind.  The skeleton managed to avoid one of the blows, but the other hit it hard enough to shatter its brittle bones.

With the skeleton no longer a threay, Vael started searching the room for magic, and they grabbed the magic axe and nonmagical mail and shield from the human skeleton, plus a magic pouch, a single magic gauntlet, a couple of magic arrows, and a spellbook from the elf skeleton.  There was a stone chest under the bed, but it was empty.  Nobody wanted to believe that, so an intensive search ensued.  When that didn't find anything, the whole stone chest went into the Bag of Holding for further investigation.

With little time left in the session, Vallium still hadn't delivered the booze to the goblins.  So the group went back to the small pyramid, flipped the lever, and ended up in Upper Goblintown (formerly the Halls of Thoth).  As they headed toward the Glory of Weskenim (formerly the Glory of Thoth), they greeted each squad of goblins they met and gave each of them a small barrel of liquor.  By the time they reached Bottleneck Halfling-Slayer, Master Sergeant of Upper Goblintown, they had a fan club of a few dozen already drunk goblins following them, while a few Designated Sober Guards had to stay behind.  Vallium tried to get some information from the goblins, and learned that Gislu the False Prophet had last been seen in the Forum of Set.


GM's Comments:

The plan to trade with the cave people actually worked, despite having no language in common.  It appears that even people who don't know your language know that getting 5 whole axes for one axe head is pretty good.

The party confirmed that the Rugs of Instant Access were useful for skipping the long climb up the Long Stair, at least if someone with Levitation was available.

The Seeker spell once again proved its worth by finding the pyramid control rod in the pit (and incidentally helping find some other treasure in that pits).  But the party already knew of two stairways between the Well of Light level and Upper Goblintown, so this was mostly completionism.

The baboons once again showed that, left unattended, some them will eventually poop on the mirrors.  (I once lived in a huge all-male freshman dorm, so I can confirm this is true.)

Everyone (especially the dwarves) seemed very interested in the Ruby Chair but nobody found a way to move it or break parts off it.

The head of Stamelis seemed to know things, but also seemed reluctant to share Thoth's secrets with random tomb robbers.  Similarly, the ghost of Ptirasa was a mix of helpful and obscure.

Vallium's plan to give goblins $500 of moonshine was a roaring success.  For most of the goblins anyway.  The ones who got Sober Guard Duty with the promise they could have some leftover moonshine later probably didn't like it much.


Achievements:
The Rescuers: 1 XP for freeing Burris from the baboon harem

XP:
Exploration: 9 new locations: 1 XP
Loot: magic axe head, magic axe, Bottomless Purse, Wand of Illumination, coins, etc: 2 XP
Achievements: 1 XP
Total: 4 XP

Next Week:
I expect more testing of the teleport rugs.  Vallium is still looking for a priest of Thoth.  There are still unexplored areas on both the Well of Light and Upper Goblintown levels.  Ioannes may be able to help with some of the mysteries of language or religion that stumped the others.  And if they run out of other things to do, they can always resume their war with the Cult of Set, or explore deeper.

Ioannes Grammatikos Byzantios, Archontean cleric of Demma (Demented Avenger)
Ethereum "Coinbase" Thuringwador, Elf Illusionist (Mercenary) (Archon Shiva)

3 giant boring beetles


The Plan:


Vallium's plan for the week was:
Leave one Rug of Instant Access at an apartment in the Arcane Practitioners' Club in Gosterwick and then teleport to it from the other Rug every mile or so on the way to Arden Vul, to find the Rugs' maximum range.
Leave the set of silver chess pieces they found last week on the dam as tribute for Craastonistorax.
Try exploring the square tower next to the Forum in the ruins of Arden Vul.  First try to get in the front door, then search for secret doors, then see if the Eyes of Set allowed seeing through the darkness on the stairs down from the roof, then try using ropes or magical flight to send someone down the stairs.
Go through the Pyramid of Thoth to the Well of Light, check on Yamki and the baboons, give the baboons some food if they're behaving, and trade Trefko a live goat (teleported in from Gosterwick using the Rugs) for his Dwarven Life-Stone.  Give Trefko a sheet to cover the mirror at the bottom of the Well when the party isn't using it, rather than having baboons poop on it.
Explore the exit up from the Well of Light, northwest of the Ruby Chair.
Explore the Howling Caves beyond the portcullis.
Go shopping at the Goblin Market.


What Actually Happened:


The Right for Riches company, without Vael or Michael but with Coinbase the head Grudge Brigade Mercenary, left Gosterwick just before dawn on Horasday.  They had a Rug of Instant Access spread out in one apartment, and a live goat left in another apartment (not the same one with the Rug).  On the ten-mile walk to the Cliff Face below Arden Vul, they stopped every mile or so, spread out the Rug, and used it to teleport someone to Gosterwick and back.  When they reached the Cliff Face, everyone except Coinbase stepped through the Rug, Coinbase Levitated up the Cliff Face with the Rug, and then everyone stepped back through the Rug to join Coinbase at the top of the cliff.  Overall, playing with the Rugs took a couple of minutes, but not having to walk all the way up the Long Stair saved over an hour, so this shortened the trip by about an hour while proving that the Rugs' range was at least ten miles.

After reaching the ruins, they walked over to the dam and left a silver Archontean chess set as tribute for the dragon.  They then walked over to the squat square tower by the Forum, where they had long ago found locked doors, bodies on the roof, and stairs down into impenetrable magical darkness.  This time the doors were still locked, and none of the many keys on Vallium's keyring fit.  The whole group circled the base of the tower looking for secret doors, and Uvash found one on the back side of the tower.  Everyone took a close look and nobody saw an obvious way to open it, until Ioannes found a small keyhole.  None of Vallium's keys fit, and nobody had lockpicks or a Lockmaster spell, and the door looked like very sturdy stone that they would not be able to break through, so they gave up on opening the secret door.

Next Coinbase Levitated everyone up, one at a time, riding in the Living Wheelbarrow.  The group assembled above the dark stairs and tried using the Eyes of Set to see through the darkness, but they did not work.  Vallium then borrowed the Ring of Climbing from Uvash, tied a rope around his waist, wrapped the rope around the ibis-head statue, and had Uvash hold onto the other end of the rope.  Vallium then went down the rickety wooden stairs, through the magical darkness, until he came out the other side into a stone passage where his Continual Light stone worked.  He yelled up that he was fine and they could send the next person down.

Ioannes came down next, again with a rope around his waist, but this time the wooden stairs collapsed under him.  Fortunately, Uvash was attentive with the rope and pulled to keep Ioannes from falling more than a couple of feet.  Uvash pulled Ioannes back up, and they switched to Plan B, where Ioannes and Uvash stepped through the Rug, then Coinbase Levitated down the broken stairs with the Rug, with a rope connecting him to Vallium.  Once Coinbase arrived next to Vallium, he laid down the Rug and the others stepped through.

Ioannes noticed that the Sanctity level was low; this place felt evil.  Uvash agreed.  There was a closed door to the north and a passage going south then east, which they followed.  The passage ended at a doorway where the door had been destroyed.  Beyond was a small room containing some destroyed desks, destroyed chairs, destroyed office supplies, another destroyed door on the far side, and a couple of old corpses.  Ioannes tried to diagnose the cause of death and didn't see any obvious wounds.

After failing to find any treasure, they continued north through the other broken door, then west to an intact door, then opened it to find a small room with a spiral stairway going down.  The other door had some writing in blood: "Do not open the doors below! They are waiting!"  Everyone was a bit creeped out, but they went down the stairs anyway.

One level down, they entered a room with three bodies on the floor, two doors (one of them spiked shut from this side), and the spiral stairs continuing down.  The bodies looked from their equipment like a warrior, a wizard, and a Thothian priest.  The equipment included some magic mail armor, a magic shield, a silver scroll case, a magic staff, a greatsword, and a pouch full of small gems.  Vallium shoved all of that into Larel's Sack.  Ioannes examined the bodies and again did not see an obvious cause of death.

They opened the unspiked door and went east then south until they reached a locked door.  Vallium slammed into it hard enough to break the lock.  Inside the room were pegs with ten different magical Thothian masks on them, picturing humans and baboons and ibises.  Nobody felt like trying one on, but they were all magical, so all of them went into the sack.  The door on the other side of the room was locked, and Vallium could not break this one.  They doubled back to the room with the stairs, took all the spikes out, and opened the southern door, which was only stuck not locked.  It led south then east to the other side of the locked door they could not open, so they figured they were done with this level and went back to the spiral stairs and down.

The spiral stairs led to another small room with two exits, and continued down further.  On the floor were a coil of magical rope, a lantern, and some lamp oil.  Vallium put the magic rope in the sack but left the other stuff.  Both doors were locked.  Vallium shouldered both of them hard, but failed to get either one open.  However, he had a file, so he went to work destroying hinges.  The hinges failed before the file broke, so the eastern door was destroyed.

They went east then south to another locked door.  Vallium used the file on this one too.  The southeastern room contained a trap door in the floor, with no obvious locks.  It also had a bunch of pegs on the walls, most of them with the tattered remains of orange Thothian robes, and one containing a bright orange silk robe in good shape, with blue embroidery.  It did not appear magical, so people were suspicious how this robe survived, but Vallium shoved it into the sack anyway.  Vallium then destroyed the hinges on another door, and led the group west.

They could now see the huge brass double doors at the front of the tower from the inside.  There was also some kind of central shaft in the middle of the tower, with a pillar in the middle with Thothian images, and a corpse on the floor in front of it.  The corpse had magical leather armor, a shortsword, and a pouch, so Vallium started taking its stuff and putting it in the sack.  While he did that, he was rudely interrupted by a floating spectral creature coming out of the central shaft.  It reached out with a ghostly hand to touch him.  Vallium fast-drew his sword to parry, but the creature's hand went right through the sword.  Coinbase, standing right next to Vallium, tried a sacrificial block with his magic shield, and that did stop the attack.  So it appeared the wraith was affected by magic shields but not non-magical swords.

A fight began, where Vallium and Coinbase both shield-bashed the wraith (because they had magic shields but not magic weapons), Ioannes started casting Affect Spirits on Vallium's sword, and Uvash moved into position.  They hit the wraith a few times but didn't seem to hurt it much.  In addition to its ghostly touch attack, it also did some kind of ranged contest of Will against Uvash that did enough damage to blow his Bless spell off, and everyone standing near it felt some kind of ghostly toxic effect that was not actually poison.

And then a second wraith appeared.  The fight continued.  Vallium got a good hack in once his sword could Affect Spirits, and Uvash pounded a wraith with Finisher, his mace enchanted against undead.  But that was not enough to stop a wraith.

And then a third wraith appeared.  At that point Coinbase said it was probably time to run.  And everyone did.  And the wraiths pursued.  As a fourth wraith appeared.

The whole group ran south, then east, then north, then west to the spiral stairs, then up two levels, with the wraiths sniffing behind.  Coinbase, the fastest runner, got far enough ahead that he stopped for a couple of seconds to cast Flight on Vallium.  Once they reached the top of the spiral stairs, they ran around the upper level to the bottom of the broken wooden stairs leading to the roof.  By then there was some distance to the wraiths, so Vallium picked up Ioannes and carried him to the roof, then came back and carried Uvash up, while Coinbase Levitated himself to the roof.  Nobody had any safety ropes this time, but they were pretty sure the mana level was fine based on their entry, and nobody thought they could afford the time to set up ropes.

Once everyone reached the roof, Vallium and Coinbase ferried them to the ground at the base of the tower.  No wraiths appeared to be following them, so Ioannes took a few minutes to heal everyone of their wraith wounds, then rested for a few minutes.  That was enough of the Tower of Scrutiny for one day, so the group walked north to the Pyramid of Thoth, manipulated its arms to open the trap door, and went down the steps to the Glory of Thoth.

Vallium knocked on the door and announced himself, and the goblin guards let them in.  There were even more goblins in Upper Goblintown than last time, and many of them were holding small orange gourds full of alcohol.  The giant ibis-headed Thoth statue was wearing a pink turban, sort of resembling the one King Weskenim wore.  Vallium mentioned to Bottleneck that this was the goblins' third week in a row of partying, and Bottleneck said that it was because they had continued to expand their territory, and also it was a goblin holiday celebration.

The group went south and west to the indoor pyramid, flipped the control rod to teleport to the other indoor pyramid on the Well of Light level, and then walked over to visit Yamki.  Yamki said that Trefko was still in his room and was still grumpy but was not causing trouble.  He said that Sisko's harem were still rude but they did not appear to have destroyed anything.  Vallium was satisfied with Yamki's story and gave him a large pile of meat that he pulled out of Larel's Sack.  Yamki gave some of the meat to each of the nearby female baboons, then headed south to the Howling Caves to feed the others.

The group headed north and west to Trefko's room.  They knocked on the door and Trefko opened it.  Trefko asked if they had his goat.  Vallium said to wait a minute, then went around a corner, spread out the Rug, walked through to the apartment in Gosterwick, went to the apartment next door with the goat, grappled the goat, and carried it back through the Rug.  He carried the squirming goat over toward Trefko.  Coinbase tried a Levitation on the goat to make it float peacefully, but the goat stubbornly resisted the spell.  Trefko ended the commotion by reaching out with two of his huge arms to grab the goat.  He then removed his dwarven life-stone necklace with his other two hands, and gave it to Uvash.  The life-stone said "Schist Corundam" in Dwarven Runic, which Uvash identified as a dwarven name, with Schist being the given name and Corundam a clan name.  Vallium asked Trefko how things were going, and he said he preferred his quiet room to all the noisy kids in the Howling Caves.  Vallium said that was fine, as long as Trefko kept the others from vandalizing the mirrors.  He gave Trefko a sheet that he could use to cover the mirror when it wasn't being used.

The party then went north and west to the hole in the ceiling.  Vallium pulled a ladder out of Larel's Sack to make it easier to reach, and everyone went up. They went north through a narrow natural cavern passage, until it opened into a cavern.  The cavern contained a half-eaten dwarf corpse, which Ioannes recognized as Gwelf, the dwarf they had freed from Gerrilad's prison, who had then run off.  Gwelf appeared to have taken a fatal blow from a large cutting weapon.  Uvash cast Final Rest on Gwelf, while Ioannes cast Bless on Uvash to replace the Bless that had absorbed a wraith attack.

The room also contained a couple of statues, a 4' marble whippet and a 5' bronze Ptah.  The bronze statue took all of Vallium's strength to budge.  Uvash spotted a single ancient gold solidi coin on the floor.  Coinbase cast Lighten Burden to make it a bit easier to manage, and Vallium took both statues and Gwelf's body through the Rug to their apartment.  While he was there, he dumped a bunch of newly found loot out of Larel's Sack.

There were two exits from the cavern, a passage north at ground level and a passage west about 25' up.  Coinbase Levitated up to take a look, but didn't see much.  The group decided "Right for Riches" meant north, and then they turned right at a fork.  This led to a passage that went down a long way, as the passage got drier.  After about half a mile of descending, the party decided to turn around and went back.

They took a few more right turns and then entered a huge underground graveyard.  There were sarcophagi scattered all over, some with blank lids, others with gisants with pictures of people and sometimes names carved in Mithric, always "Brother Someone."  Coinbase tentatively flew around to map the room, and found several mausoleums along the north and south walls.  The room felt creepy, with Low Sanctity.  After much discussion, they decided to take the lid off a sarcophagus near the entrance where it would be easier to run.  Inside was an inert mummy and some ancient silver coins.  They decided not to rob the grave, and opened a second one.  This one contained a ghoul, who attacked them.  It was four on one, so the ghoul didn't last long.  There was also some silver in this one, and they decided to take it, since the ghoul had attacked them.

After more discussion, they decided to open the door of the mausoleum in the southwest corner.  Inside was a platform with a mummy on it.  The mummy sat up, and everyone ran -- after a recent fight with two mummies, and fleeing for their lives from four wraiths, they didn't feel like a fight with one mummy plus a possibly large number of its friends.  Once they left the graveyard room, nothing seemed to follow.

They took another right turn and went northeast, to where they spotted three giant beetles munching on the corpse of a bull-headed biped.  Coinbase summoned a couple of semi-illusionary phantoms, and they grappled the beetles while Vallium stabbed them.  There was no treasure, but Vallium rug-teleported the half-eaten minotaur corpse and one of the beetle corpses back to their apartment.

They then went west until they found a room with a lot of spider webs.  Some large spiders started jumping down and bit one of Coinbase's illusions, actually dispelling it.  There were enough spiders that the group decided they should leave rather than contining the fight, and they fled from the third battle of the delve.

The group found a crossroads with three exits, labeled "E" and "W" and "N" in big red letters.  They continued in the direction they thought was southeast (despite the labels) until Vallium accidentally discovered a pit trap and started to fall in.  He used his Luck to reroll his DX check then caught himself on the edge.  After he climbed out, they pulled the cover off and looked in the pit.  Not finding any treasure, they continued and found a second covered pit.  There was nothing inside that one either.  After bypassing the pits, they made it back to their entrance to this level, and went back to the Well of Light.  They visited the Library to grab the broken tripod for the mirror, and put it in Larel's Sack to bring it back to Gosterwick for repair.  Then they walked back home.



GM's Comments:


They escaped the Tower of Scrutiny without dying.  The wraiths are no joke.  They found the Tower back in Session 1 with 125 point PCs, and if they'd gone in back then, it probably would have been a TPK.  But now they're powerful enough to run away more effectively.  (Also, props to Coinbase for calling for retreat at the right time.  Another couple of turns and they might not have made it.)

When the party found that deeply descending tunnel and turned around, they didn't actually want to turn around.  I told them the map they were approaching wasn't ready, so they had to turn around (or pause there), but it would be ready for next session.  This is the first time this has happened in this campaign, so they got an achievement for it.  (It's a one-time-only achievement as I don't want them deliberately trying to exceed the limits of the mapped area.)

The Rugs of Instant Access are the kind of magic item that totally changes the game.  They players are still figuring them out, but got a lot of use out of them.  (Including questionable uses like teleporting random monster corpses back to their apartments.)


Achievements:

Outsmarted the GM: 1 XP for reaching an area where the map wasn't ready (one time only)

XP:
Exploration: 1 XP for 15 new locations
Loot: It sounds like they'll sell enough of the magic armor and masks to get 2 XP
Achievements: 1 XP
Total: 4 XP

Next Week:

My guess is they won't go back to the Tower of Scrutiny.  They might resume exploring the tunnels above the Well of Light, or try to finish the unexplored parts of the Well of Light or Halls of Thoth, or go looking for the Troll Lifts, or something else.  They keep finding new places to explore faster than they finish exploring old places.

What Happened:


Uvash led some members of his dwarven flock to bury the fallen dwarf adventurer Gwelf, whose body they had found in a cavern the previous week.

Lyssandra left messages on everyone's apartment doors at the Arcane Practitioners' Club, that livestock and corpses were not permitted on the premises.  Also that all apartment tenants must leave by the first of Dikaios, when renovations to the top floor would commence.  The lounge, alchemy labs, training rooms, and library on the lower floors would not be affected.

Creon sent Vael a note that he had some newly arrived magical items.  The items were a very expensive magical knife, a suit of magical scale armor, and an invisibility potion.  Vael didn't buy any of them, but paid Creon a tip for continuing to let him know about interesting items before they went on the shelves.  Vael did spot and purchase a couple of items from market peddlers: a mapping kit and a hands-free helmet lamp.

Vael went looking for Wicktrimmer to see if he had any ideas about apartments, but the goblin was not available.

The Right for Riches company left for Arden Vul just after dawn on Lunday.  They made it to the base of the waterfall without encountering anyone, but saw a trail of people and mules heading up, about a quarter of the way up the Long Stair.  Everyone else stepped through the Rug back to Gosterwick, then Vael Levitated about halfway up the Long Stair to outside the secret entrance to the Great Cavern, and let the others come back through.  They waited there for the mule train, which turned out to be a merchant and six armed guards, each leading a mule.  Two of the guards came forward to talk.  They revealed that they were heading up to the [[locations/Inn of the Broken Head.md|Inn of the Broken Head]] with supplies.  Once he was convinced of their peaceful intentions, the merchant, Flavius Aurelius, came up to chat.  He revealed that he and his men regularly brought supplies from Gosterwick up to the Broken Head.  Vael asked to exchange contact information so they could talk again sometime in Gosterwick, and Flavius agreed.

Once the mule train was out of sight, the party opened the secret door, and Vallium led them east then north then west through narrow passages into the Great Cavern proper.  They repeated the trick with everyone stepping through the Rug, Vallium Levitating up to the top of the rock outcropping, then everyone stepping back out.  The shaft they wanted to explore was about 5 feet in diameter and extended beyond the range of their light sources.  Vael cast Trace on his Returning Pebble then dropped it into the hole.  The spell told him that it fell about 70 feet, bounced a few times, then settled there.  Vael was a bit nervous to fly down into the hole alone, so Vallium tied a 100 foot rope around his waist, spiked it in place at the top and had the others hold it, and then climbed down while Vael Levitated.  At the bottom was a cavern and there did not appear to be any danger, so Vallium stayed at the bottom to stand guard, while Vael flew up, let everyone step into the Rug, flew down, and let everyone step out.

The group explored the small cave.  It was unoccupied, but had a few interesting features.  There was what looked like a black flowering plant, impossibly growing in the pitch dark.  There was also a sheet spread out on the ground.  On the sheet were a couple of flasks of a strange light orange material, a couple of small discs of a strange heavy orange material, some unidentifiable dried fruit, and some unidentifiable and extremely old dried meat.  They took the objects, left the old food, and did not disturb the plant.

There was another shaft heading down.  Vael again cast Trace on his Pebble and dropped it.  This time it fell around 170' before bouncing around a bit.  That was longer than any rope they had, so Vael sent down a Wizard Eye spell to explore.  The spell revealed a cavern complex, with one large cavern containing a pool of water, and another tunnel sloping down.  It looked unoccupied, so Vael had everyone step into the Rug, flew down, and let everyone step out.

The group thoroughly explored the cave.  They didn't find any occupants or treasure, or any exits except for the tunnel sloping down.  Vallium swam around in the chilly pool, which appeared to be fresh water, about 30' deep.  Eventually they took the tunnel down, but then turned back around before exploring the deeper level.  Everyone climbed back up, then stepped into the Rug, and Vael flew all the way up to the rock then back down to the surface of the Great Cavern, and everyone stepped back out.

They walked west a bit to the base of the pillar atop which Vael had seen some kind of classical temple.  He flew up to take a look, then repeated the Rug trick to teleport everyone else up.  There was what looked like a classical marble temple on top of the pillar, and in the center of it was a large sarcophagus.  It was surrounded by 8 urns, about 4' in diameter and 4' tall.  There was a Mithric inscription on the sarcophagus:

Here rests Ptarmis
loyal servant of Thoth
seeker of hidden ways
who destroyed the loathsome ones
raised his children from spores
and opened this cavern
Those who disturb his sleep
Will be returned to the mulch
from whence they came.

This was a bit confusing, since they'd met a man named Ptarmis, on the throne a bit to the east, who was very much alive.  Vael looked over to see if he was there, and he was.  He flew over to chat.  Ptarmis indicated that the temple was his, like everything in the Great Cavern was his, and that they should leave it alone.  Surprisingly, the party complied, and left without opening the sarcophagus or the urns.

Next they continued west to the Settite outpost.  Vael used Larel's Cloak to turn invisible, and cast Infravision so he could hide his light, and flew over to check it out.  There were no guards on the landing.  He kicked the rope ladder down so the others could climb up, and explored into the tunnel to the west.  The stores of food were gone, and then all the furniture in the Settite guard lounge room was gone.  It looked like the Settites had abandoned the area.  The door north was locked, but Vallium had a key, and unlocked it, then another door north, then another door west, to find the stairs leading down to the Forum of Set level.

The group snuck down the stairs, wary of the Varumani guards they saw last time, but this time they didn't see any varumani in the octagonal crossroads room.  There was just one bat, suspiciously orbiting the room.  Chrysalis decided she didn't like the bat, and used her long staff to knock it down, fatally.  When it hit the ground, its corpse changed from a bat into a strange worm, and remained dead.

They explored a few tunnels until they found a large room to the south.  There were 6 plinths, with name plaques.  5 of them contained statues, with 4 of the statues complete and one of them headless, with colorful magical sparks shooting out of its neck.  There was a separate smaller platform in front of each plinth.  There were large letters in Mithric on the south wall "Let the Worthy Illuminate the" and then the sentence was rudely interrupted by a hole in the wall.  The missing statue was "Priscus Pulcher, the Arch-Sortian" and there were some fresh flowers there.  The intact statues were "Licinia the Seer", "Plotinus Quartus Claudino, Archon", "Yeth, Who Sought to Bring Law to Chaos", and "Horatius Interfector, Sorcerer."  The headless statue with the spark show was "Thrygga the Mighty", and he was wearing some impossibly fantastic armor, a bit similar to what the Sun-Scarred Knight Sir Sorrow had worn.  Some of these names were vaguely familar but none of the party was a historian.  Vael tried putting Continual Light stones near each statue, which didn't seem to do anything.  He also put a piece of paper in the spark shower and succeeded in setting it on fire.

Tiring of the statues, the group explored a few more tunnels, then went west, to a big blue pillar they had seen before.  The pillar had statues on several sides: of a handsome man, a woman, a varumani, a Thothian priest, and a goblin.  Vallium had made a note to bring old coins, but had not actually brought any.  Fortunately they had the teleport rugs, so he walked through one back to their apartments, grabbed several coins and gems, and came back.  He determined that the woman's eyes were a perfect fit for gold solidi, and the priest's eyes for ancient silver pennies.  The handsome man's eyes, varumani's mouth, and goblin's nose also had holes, but none of those matched the size of any coins or gems in their collection.  Vallium put two solidi in the woman's eye holes, and the whole group was instantly half-blinded by bright light as they were teleported outside, near the old Archon's palace.  Unfortunately they were about ten feet above the ground, so everyone (except Vael, who still had Levitation on) fell to the ground with a painful thump.  While Ioannes healed falling damage, Uvash mentioned that he had seen a short obelisk on the other side of the palace wall, before they fell.  Vael Levitated up and saw that the obelisk was covered with lunar symbols and had an ankh-shaped hole, much like the Obelisk of the Sun near the entrance to Arden Vul, except this one had been broken and only the bottom 10 feet remained.

Remembering something they had read about sun and moon and stars, the group determined that if they'd found the moon obelisk, they should see if they could find the star obelisk to complete the set.  Vael looked for a third obelisk on the line between the others but didn't see it.  He then tried a Seeker spell, concentrating on the moon obelisk, to find another one like it but with stars.  He was rewarded with a vision of the Obelisk of the Stars, in the swamp to the southwest.  He flew up and looked that way, until he also spotted it with the naked eye.  They considered visiting all the obelisks now, but something in the story they remembered had said "mid-day", and it was already afternoon, so they decided to come back another day before noon in case the exact timing mattered.

The group decided to go back to the Blue Pillar.  They walked east across the bridge toward the Pyramid of Thoth, south through the Forum, past the scary Tower of Scrutiny, past the Obelisk of the Sun, and down the Long Stair to the secret door.  They then retraced their steps across the Great Cavern to the west, climbed the rope ladder into the former Set outpost, went down the stairs, and went west again to the Blue Pillar.  After all that walking, and with no significant loot found, Vael announced that it was time to look for treasure, and cast Seek Earth looking for platinum.  He sensed some, a bit to the northwest.  There were no passages going that way, and nobody found any secret doors, so they went east then north up some stairs, hoping they could loop around.  The stairs went up a long way, and there were periodic frescoes of faces in agony.  There were also some magical noses on the walls, which started sniffing as they passed.  No enemies came, so the group ignored the noses and pressed on.

Ahead, they heard some conversation, as if someone was searching for someone.  They snuck up and saw four Settites, facing the other way toward a closed door.  Wordlessly, they ambushed the Settites.  Vallium shield-rushed one to the ground, chopped him up, then chopped another one.  Mariposa the monkey tied one of the Settites up in cloaks, while Chrysalis smashed him with a staff.  Uvash paused for a second to activate his Divine Grace, then ran up behind a wounded Settite and smashed his skull in.  The last surviving Settite tried to surrender, but nobody wanted to deal with prisoners, and he died under a hail of cuts and blows from all sides.

Vallium forced open the door to the west, and there was a large man hiding behind it.  Seeing they were not dressed like Settites, he came out and revealed that his name was Harold and that he'd been hiding from the slavers.  He had come to the Halls with an adventuring group to explore old tombs and take treasures that their owners no longer needed.  But then their leader, Gillen, had decided to turn bandit, capturing travelers and selling them to the slavers.  Harold considered himself a respectable tomb robber, not an evil bandit or slaver, so left the group.  Unfortunately he had gotten lost and had attracted the attention of the Settite "Guild of Service" and thought he was about to be captured and thrown into a slave pit, until the Right for Riches company came and killed the slavers.  They believed his story, and offered to guide him out.

Everyone continued north up the stairs to another room, in which two badly wounded men were stapled to a punishment frame.  One was missing both hands, unconscious, and bleeding to death.  The other was in better shape, and identified himself as Hjalti.  He said the other man was Kiglon.  Ioannes healed both of them, then they let both men down.  Neither looked to be in any shape to walk far, so he cast more healing spells until both men were able to walk a bit better and Kiglon woke up.  Then they told both men that they would be able to teleport them to a temple in Gosterwick where they would be safe, if they promised not to reveal the secret of the teleportation.  Both men agreed, as did Harold, and then Ioannes took all three of them through the Rug, back to an apartment at the Arcane Practitioner's Club in Gosterwick, then to the Temple of Demma.  Ioannes came back through the Rug alone about 30 minutes later, and the others had not been interrupted.

Vael tried another Seek Earth spell and detected platinum again, this time to the southwest.  Figuring they'd missed a secret door, he pulled out the Wand of See Secrets and used a charge.  It immediately found a secret door to the southwest.  He ran around the previously explored territory until the spell ran out, but didn't find any more secrets.  Returning to the secret door that the wand had found, Vael was able to see the outline of the door, but not a handle or a catch or a keyhole or any way to open it.  Everyone else looked, and nobody else found anything either.  Vael used Shape Earth to just rip a hole in the wall, which worked.

A narrow passage and a few steps down led to a room with several empty sarcophagi and a workbench with some tools and jars.  The jars contained some kind of embalming spices.  There was an obvious door north, but some searching found a secret door south.

Behind the secret door was a small room containing a blood-encrusted altar.  Both clerics felt the sanctity level dip to Pure Evil.  The non-clerics searched the altar but didn't find anything.  Ioannes exorcised it, which made him feel better but didn't diminish the feeling of evil.  Eventually Chrysalis got suspicious and figured out the altar was a scary illusion, and put her staff through it.  Once she pointed it out, the others were able to see it as well, and they searched the room and found another secret door leading south.

The room to the south contained a big block of granite, like a sarcophagus but with no obvious lid or way to open it.  It had a small hemispherical depression on the top.  It was inscribed "Theskelon is in me I am in Theskelon" and "Let Set devour the rays of his old rival".  The plastered walls had several Settite images that were a combination of flat painting and three dimensional sculpture, with some real objects incorporated.  There was a black boar with a sun in its jaws, a crocodile eating a heron, a Set animal squatting on a turtle, and a human priest of Set chopping a baboon with an axe.  The sun, the boar's eye, the heron's legs, the turtle shell, and the axe head were distinct objects.

Everyone got into position, and Vallium tried smashing the granite block, which did nothing.  Chrysalis then tried a Power Blow to smash the block harder, still nothing.  Finally Vael told the warriors to stand aside and used a Shape Earth spell to open the block, which also failed.

Someone asked about the size of the sun versus the depression, and the sun was a bit too big to fit.  Vallium ripped the sun off the wall and started peeling the plaster off the outside, revealing a golden orb that would fit in the depression.  Once he inserted it, the granite shell exploded into dust, revealing a smaller gold and lapis sarcophagus, shaped like a Settite priest with folded arms.

Vallium opened the inner sarcophagus, but as he did a fire trap exploded, burning him.  All the others who were foolishly standing too close had to dive out of the way, but none were injured.  Ioannes healed Vallium's burns, and then they looked inside the sarcophagus.  It contained some human bones with gold signet ring (inscribed "Theskelon the Master") around one finger.  There were also three copper plaques with maps on them, along with glyphs in an unknown language and notes in Mithric.  There were three books, one in Mithric (about creating mummies) and two in unknown languages.  Finally, there was a key, which Vallium immediately added to his huge keyring.

Uvash cast Final Rest on the bones, hoping that would stop them from going undead and attacking.  Vallium set up the Rug and carried the gold and lapis inner sarcophagus (which was too big to fit in Larel's Sack and too heavy easily carry home) through, then came back.  They gathered up the other treasure in Larel's Sack, then retraced their steps back to Gosterwick.

GM's Comments:

This blog is starting to feel like an infomercial for the Rugs of Instant Access.  ("But that's not all!  If you order in the next ten minutes we'll throw in a third Rug!")

For the second week in a row, we had some technical difficulties in Foundry VTT.  Last week it was the PCs trying to visit a map that wasn't ready, my fault.  This time, the map they wanted to visit was ready, but a new module I'd added to Foundry (Map Coordinates) was causing problems loading large maps, including that one.  So they had to turn around before exploring that new level, and we also had to do the Arden Vul Ruins part (when the blue pillar teleported them to the surface) theater-of-the-mind since that map wouldn't load either.  I figured out the problem after the session was over and removed that module, so now they're clear to visit those maps again.

This session was fairly light on combat (just two one-sided fights against the single bat-worm and the four surprised Settite slavers) and loot (just that one tomb, plus the slavers' stuff and a few odd items they found in a cave), but the PCs explored a lot and rescued three more people from the Settites.


Achievements:
The Rescuers, for rescuing Harold and Hjalti and Kiglon, 1 XP

XP:
Exploration: 16 new locations, good for 1 XP
Loot: orange objects, slavers' gear, stuff from tomb, good for 1 XP
Achievements: 1 XP
Total:  3 XP


Next Week:


Will they go back down to one of the deeper levels that they've been foiled from visiting by technical issues, or will they stick to the surface ruins and try to figure out the Obelisks?  Will they find a new place to live that's more tolerant of live goats and dead giant beetles?  Will the Rugs of Instant Access demand a full share of loot and XP?

What Happened:

Michael and Vallium got matching letters from Wicktrimmer that the mule caravan from Narsileon with their items had arrived.  Michael also got a letter from his mother that his father was sick and he should come home.  They went to the Rarities Factor where Vallium picked up his new sword and Michael got his new scale armor, both already paid in advance.

Michael then made plans to leave.  His plan was to travel down the Imperial road to Newmarket, then all the way to Narsileon on the sea, then catch a ship down to Sweetwater Hold in southeastern Irthuin, then walk to his family's home from there.  He first settled up with the Right for Riches Company.  They agreed to give him a magic shield, a few healing potions, and the Belt of Strength as his share of party items.  Vael and Michael went to their lawyer's office and had him draw up a separation agreement to make it official; if Michael ever came back and rejoined the Right for Riches company it would be as a new member, with no claim to any pre-existing items.

Vael wanted to test the range of the Rugs of Instant Access, so he proposed that the group walk with Michael for a while, either until the Rugs stopped working or until they reached Narsileon.  (If they made it all the way to Narsileon with the Rugs still working, they would rent a place there and leave a Rug then teleport back, losing the tactical use of the Rugs but gaining instant access to a real city.)  It took a bit less than three days to hike the 60 miles to Newmarket.  On the fourth day, a bit south of Newmarket, the Rug stopped working.  They turned around and went back a bit and confirmed the Rug worked again; it appeared the range limit was about 60 miles.  At that point the Right for Riches company said goodbye to Michael and headed back north, and he resumed hiking south alone, at a noticeably faster speed.

It took three days to hike back to Gosterwick.  When they got there Uvash was still busy trying to convert Torunn the Smith to Zodarrim, but they'd just lost most of a week walking to Newmarket and back, so they went to the Grudge Brigade and hired Ashe the goblin.  They got up early the next morning and walked to Arden Vul, wanting to be there well before noon because the obelisks of the sun and moon said something about "midday life" and they interpreted that as "put the ankhs in the obelisks before noon".

At the base of the Long Stair, Vallium and Ioannes stepped through the Rug back to Gosterwick, while Vael and Ashe Levitated up the Cliff Face,with several bats flying as escorts.  They made it to the top safely, so Vael laid out the Rug and Vallium and Ioannes joined them.  Levitating rather than climbing the Long Stair saved about an hour, so they had a couple of hours left before noon.

The group walked over to the dam to leave tribute for Craas.  Vael noticed a scroll case on top of the dam.  Inside was a note from Craas, saying that the silver chess pieces were "appropriate tribute" but then listing several complaints, like the missing chess board, the pieces being the wrong colors, and the archons being larger than the dragons.  Everyone said some rude things about Craas, quietly, then Vael wrote a polite note back rather than risking dragon wrath.  They left a magic amulet that only worked for Settites as additional tribute.

Vael pointed out the Obelisk of the Stars.  The swamp between the dam and the obelisk looked wet and slow to traverse, so Vael cast Walk on Air on Vallium and Ioannes so they could get there faster.  There were a few ruined buildings near the swamp that people wanted to investigate, but they didn't want to risk taking too long so they only poked around for a couple of minutes, and didn't find anything.  When everyone reached the obelisk, they read the inscriptions and looked at the pictures of stars, then inserted one of the silver ankhs.  Nothing seemed to happen.

They noted a long intact building and discussed investigating it, but decided to do that later and finish with the obelisks first.  They went east toward a bridge, and spotted a large statue with the head missing.  They thought it was probably Vul the Sorcerer based on the resemblance to the Colossus of Vul on the Cliff Face, but couldn't be completely sure without the head.  They didn't see the head anywhere, and continued east across the bridge to the island in the middle of the Swift River, south of the Palace.  They went north to the palace wall, beyond which they had found the bottom part of the Obelisk of the Moon.  (The top part was nowhere to be seen.)  Vael grabbed an ankh from Vallium, Levitated over the wall, and put the ankh in the obelisk.  Again, nothing obvious happened.

They continued east over the other bridge and again saw the plinth with the feet and ankles of a large statue, but with the rest of the statue missing.  They compared the scale and thought that might be the statue of Arden whose head was above the door of the Inn of the Broken Head, but could not be completely sure.  (Vallium was keeping a list of large statue pieces and their locations in case they needed them in the future.)  They continued east to the Forum, went nowhere near the tower full of wraiths, went south to the Obelisk of the Sun, and discussed whether to insert the third ankh immediately or wait for noon.  They decided to insert it early then wait for noon, to avoid possibly inserting it too late.

Everyone watched the shadows to see when noon approached.  Vael Levitated up a bit to get a better view.  When the shadows disappeared, they heard a loud crashing sound to the northwest.  Vael impatiently flew over and was the first to notice a new hole in the ground, on the southern part of the island with the palace.  Looking into the hole, there were some stairs leading into the earth, ending at some large bronze doors.  Camilla the bat flew ahead and checked out the doors, magically relaying a picture of them back to Ashe.  The non-flying members of the party walked across a narrow iron footbridge to the island.  It didn't collapse under them, but Ashe decided not to send any summoned bears across it, just in case they were too heavy.

Everyone investigated the doors at the bottom of the stairs.  They were huge and bronze and sturdy looking and magical.  There were carvings of Thoth and Set (who everyone recognized) and Anubis and Horus (who Ioannes identified), all holding up their right hands in the universal sign for stop.  There was a big Mithric sign saying "Chamber of the Beacon.  Enter only with Permission of the Archon.  Speak the password to open.”  There were no obvious keyholes.  Vallium pushed on the door, but it was locked.  Everyone started guessing passwords, but only a couple of the party members spoke Mithric (which they assumed the password would be in), so they had to translate the others' guesses.  After a bunch of guesses that had no effect, Vael said "Open Sesame" in Mithric, and as soon as he said "open" in Mithric ("aperire") the door clicked unlocked.  (Apparently the ancient Archonteans were terrible at passwords.)

Vallium pushed the door open.  This revealed a large room, with a couple of statues in the back corners.  Angry statues, charging at him.  Vallium fought the two stone constructs, while two of Ashe's bat swarms and a summoned wild boar tried to help.  (Ashe's cave bears were too big for him to maintain down here where Nature's Sanctity was weak.)  The bats and boars didn't seem strong enough to penetrate the constructs' stone armor, and didn't even manage to distract them enough to soak any hits, but Vallium's enchanted broadsword worked fine.  He blocked and parried many punches from the constructs, and two sword cuts to each construct put them down.  Ioannes and Vael and Ashe stood in the back preparing to cast spells to help, but once Vallium downed the first construct they decided he had the fight under control and just watched from a few steps back.

The room had a bunch of frescoes on the walls in great condition, legionnaires and archons to the left, priests of Thoth and Set and Horus to the right.  There were wooden doors left and right, and a passage to a stone door straight ahead.  The group listened to the left door, heard nothing, and Vallium opened it.  Beyond was a workshop, with many benches, covered with tools and some odd devices.  The party spent a few minutes looking at the various devices, failed to really identify any of them, and started shoving them in their Bag of Holding.  They searched for secret doors but didn't find any.

They went across the room to the other wooden door, listened again, and opened it.  They found a rather luxurious reading room, full of nice furniture and bookshelves containing many books.  Three walls were decorated with images of Thoth, Set, and Horus.  Vael immediately started valuing the furniture and wondering which pieces they could carry through the Rug, but they didn't actually bother taking any furniture yet.  They did shove all the books in their Bag, though.  While they were taking books, a thin flat oval disc fell out of one.  It looked like the unexplained orange disc they had bought at the Goblin Market, but this one was pale green.  Once again they searched for secret doors, and this time Vael spotted an ibis fresco on the north wall that looked suspicious, with a slot in its beak.  He tried the small oval disc in the slot and it fit and the door opened.  Inside were a bunch more odd devices, including some that looked somewhat recognizable like a helmet and a shield, and others that were just weird.  Once again they put everything small enough to fit in their magic bag.

They searched for more secret doors, didn't find any, and went north to the stone door.  This one had a keyhole, but none of Vallium's keys fit.  Vael Lockmastered it open.  Beyond was a room with three more exits, all of them strange round doors with no obvious handles or keyholes.  Vallium remembered seeing one door like that before, behind the waterfall, but failing to open it.  (They had not had a wizard with them at the time, though.)  There was also a portable blackboard in the center of the room, covered with various writing in Mithric, some of it sensible, some of it just jumbled letters and numbers.  Vael pulled out pen and paper and copied everything from the board.

They then went west.  There was no obvious way to open the round door.  Vael held the pale green oval disc to it, and it opened, in slices like an iris.  Beyond was a small room, with a silver circle on the floor, and a gold square next to the circle on the wall.  They tried various combinations of holding things up to the circle and pushing the square and standing on the square, but nothing happened.  Nothing appeared magical either.  It was odd.

They went back to the east and opened the other iris door with the green oval.  It was the mirror image of the other room, with another silver disc and another gold square.  They once again tried a lot of things, but nothing happened.

Giving up on those rooms, they went north.  The green oval worked on that door too.  They went back and also tried the orange oval on all three doors, and it also worked.  To the north was a passage, with the east side collapsed, and the west side leading to another round door.  Against one wall were some wooden benches, a sign reading “The Beacon – Source of the Old Ones’ Power", and an arrow pointing west.

The green disk opened the western door too, and beyond it was a very confusing room.  It was all brilliantly lit with what appeared to be hidden Continual Light spells, but did not radiate magic.  The room contained 6 oversized chairs in various colors, fixed to the floor.  On the walls beyond some of the chairs were black mirrors, with odd switches and dials in front of them.  There were a couple of podiums with more such controls.  Finally there was an oval hole in the floor, with a little ridge around it.  It led down to another level beneath, but there was no ladder.

Ashe sent a bat down to scout the floor underneath, and didn't see anything that looked dangerous.  Vael sat in the central chair, which was way too big for him, and smoothly swiveled side to side on a pin.  It had cavities in both armrests, with a blinking red light in each, clearly magical but not detecting as such.  They tried putting various things in the cavities, but nothing seemed to have any effect.

Vael Levitated down through the hole in the floor, but something else interfered with his Levitation and pushed him down, then stopped him at the floor below.  Eventually the others followed him; there was some kind of levitation effect in the shaft that worked even without the spell, and was not detected as magic.  A passage northwest led to a round door straight ahead, with other doors left and right.  They chose left, for loot.

This door opened as they approached, without needing to hold up a disc.  Beyond was a room with many chairs in different colors around a long oval table.  On the table were three large sheets of parchment.  All of them had maps.  The first appeared to be a map of the two-level area they were in, with annotations by several rooms.  The rooms they hadn't visited yet were "power" and "strange ghost".  The second map was another two-level building, labeled "[[locations/Barracks of the Old Ones.md|Barracks of the Old Ones]]" in Mithric.  The third map appeared to lead to some tomb, somewhere in the Halls.

They went to the room labeled "power" on the map.  It was full of a lot of odd machinery they did not recognize.  Vael somehow avoided pushing any buttons.  They went to the room labeled "strange ghost" on the map.  It led to a room with many small round tables surrounded by chairs.  There was also a bar along one wall with some kind of drink faucets.  And there was also indeed a strange ghost.

The translucent form was about 7' tall, with two arms and two legs, wearing an unfamiliar outfit.  It had brown skin, no hair, two small horns, and one less finger on each hand than expected.  As they approached, it greeted them in Mithric.  Vael and Ioannes, who spoke Mithric, engaged it in a long conversation, while Vallium and Ashe watched.

The ghostly creature was named Akla-Chah, and she was a Rudishva.  Sort of.  She was an illusion of a Rudishva.  Kind of.  She was a construct built by the Rudishva and appeared to them as an illusion of a Rudishva, because her job was talking to Rudishva and they were more comfortable talking to someone who looked like them.  But she was actually not a biological rudishva, but a construct.  But she considered herself a Rudishva anyway.

This did not really explain the situation, because they had no idea what a Rudishva was.  But she had a lot of questions and they answered them.  Their names, their species (she recognized Vallium and Ioannes as human but Vael looked somewhat different and Ashe looked very different), why not everyone spoke Mithric, what other languages they did speak, who they worked for, why no humans had come to visit in a long time, how they found the Beacon, their goals, who they worked for, etc.  It went on for a long time.  Akla-Chah was good at asking questions.  They eventually figured out that was her job -- she was a psychologist and morale officer for the Rudishva, whoever they were.  Her projection only worked in this room, so could not leave, but she said her actual form was somewhere else.

The short version was that the Beacon was a Rudishva vehicle that had crashed into Arden Vul many years ago and had been unable to leave.  The surviving Rudishva (and their allies, the Varumani and Varuda) survived here, trying to find a way home.  But then some horrible treason happened and most of them were killed and it was too painful to get into details.  Later the ancient Archonteans had come to Arden Vul and discovered this piece of the Beacon and rudely interrogated Akla-Chah, but eventually they stopped coming and she didn't know why.

Also, this room was a cafeteria, and they were welcome to food and drink from the machines along one wall.  Vael pushed the food button and got an Arden Vul cake (very filling and nutritious, but not that tasty) like the ones they had once seen in the market in Gosterwick.  Ioannes pushed the drink button and got some very strong alcohol, stronger than any of them had tasted before.  It was too strong for him, but some of the others liked it better, and Akla-Chah said they were free to take some to go, so they filled a canteen and a couple of wineskins.

Vael pulled out some of the artifacts they had found earlier, and Akla-Chah identified a few as possibly weapons but was not too sure, as she was a talker not a fighter, and had only seen pictures of such weapons in Rudishva entertainment media, er, moving books, that might not be accurate.  She did identify the ovals as keycards that controlled access to doors, and said that the different colors of cards were for different people with different ranks and access levels, and that some of the cards were of colors she had not seen before and might be fakes.  Vael asked what the best color was, and Akla-Chah said the captain's card was gold.  They asked where the captain was, and Akla-Chah said that Captain Leil-Jor was killed in the treason, and she didn't know where her body was.  Vael asked if there were any other constructs like her, and Akla-Chah said there was one other, but he went crazy and they should avoid him.

After they ran out of questions, the party left Akla-Chah, but said they'd be back soon.  They tested that they could open the secret door from both sides, left one of the Rugs inside the secret door, then went outside.  Vael flew to all three obelisks and pulled out the ankhs.  This did not cause the steel doors over the stairwell to re-close.  Much investigation of the steel doors did not reveal an easy way to close them.  They were not directly magical, and it they appeared to weigh many tons, more than Vallium's strength or Vael's Apportation spell could lift.  Maybe they could lift them with a large team of oxen or a dwarven engineering team or a dragon, but they wanted to cover the stairs quickly before anyone else spotted them.  So they decided to instead build a cover over the stairwell.

Vael and Ashe cast Shape Earth many times (so each casting would use a manageable amount of mana) to create essentially a bridge of stone logs above the stairway.  They then used more Shape Earth spells to close the gaps between the pieces, and finally Ashe threw a bunch of dirt and sticks on top of the stone to try to camouflage the cover.  They completely sealed it up, leaving no hole to get in or out, so they'd need another Shape Earth (or stone-cutting tools and time) to get back in.  But with the Rug inside, they could also just teleport in from Gosterwick.

With their tracks covered, they went over to the nearby lake to look for treasure.  Ashe used Water Vision and reported a wrecked barge on the bottom about 50 feet down.  Also a huge turtle and a bunch of big crocodiles.  They formulated a plan to search the barge.  Vallium, wearing the Ring of Free Action to let him move through water quickly, would get Breathe Water and Water Vision spells from Ashe and Flight and Mage Sight from Vael.  He would then fly above the wreck, dive down into it, and look for treasure.

Unfortunately, the huge turtle was staying near the wreck, looking up at Vallium.  Vallium wasn't in the mood to be eaten by the turtle, so he flew over and conferred with Ashe.  Ashe summoned two hammerhead sharks, large but not as large as the turtle.  They swam over toward the turtle, who saw interesting prey and gave chase.  The sharks, who were faster than the turtle, led the turtle toward the northwest corner of the lake.  This gave Vallium an opening, and he flew down through the water to the wreck.  Inside were two fairly rotten wooden chests.  He punched holes through the rotted wood of the first.  It was full of small ancient silver pennies and the large ancient gold solidi.  He grabbed all the gold he could, stuffing it quickly into his bag, then went over to the second chest, which was much larger.  It had a mix of items: a few gold medallions, some more silver ankhs, a magic bastard sword, a magic wand, a huge magic gold key, and three regular-sized keys.  Vallium got really excited about all the keys, but remembered to also take the other stuff.  He decided he had enough time to go back to the first chest and grab the silver coins, then flew straight up out of the water.  The turtle was still busy chasing sharks, so he went back toward shore, where Vael and Ashe were each focused on maintaining several spells while Ioannes was checking for danger and asking to see if either needed more mana.

Once Vallium reached the shore, they dropped all the spells (to the disappointment of the hungry turtle who really wanted shark), rested a bit, then walked back to Gosterwick.  They had a bag full of treasure and a story nobody would believe.  


GM's Comments:

It took them 31 delves, but they finally found what appears to be definitive proof that extraterrestrials visited Magae.  They also thought to look in the lake that they've walked next to dozens of times, and were rewarded with some treasure.


Achievements:

First Contact in a While: 1 XP for meeting Akla-Chah.


XP:
Exploration:  18 new locations, good for 1 XP.
Loot: They kept the books and Rudishva artifacts, but the treasure from the lake was worth 2 XP.
Achievements: 1 XP
Total: 4 XP

Next week:

They're currently planning to explore an unexplored bit of the Great Cavern, then go way down the stairs from the Set level to the Arden level behind the waterfall, and see if the keycards from the Beacon also work on the round door they found there.

What Happened:

Vael spent most of the week learning some spoken Rudishva from Akla-Chah, while she learned some spoken Archontean from Vael.  (They started with Mithric in common.)  By the end of the week Vael knew quite a few Rudishva words and phrases but still had a lot of grammar and vocabulary to learn.  Meanwhile, Akla-Chah was speaking Archontean fairly fluently, but with a disturbingly Vael-like inflection.

Uvash spent most of the week reading the Rudishva Devices book and taking careful notes, but did not yet quite trust himself to start experimenting with the Rudishva artifacts.  He urged his companions to also study the book so that they could compare notes and start devising a plan to experiment, but none of the others shared his Dwarven fascination with the technology.

Ioannes and Vallium spent most of the week back in Gosterwick, researching and brewing potions and carousing.  Vallium sadly found that, despite his willingness to buy drinks, nobody was sharing much new information with him, and actually noticed an elf writing down everything he said.

On Lunday, they all teleported back to the Beacon using the Rugs of Instant Access, along with the mercenary archer Lacrymosa.  Vael cast Shape Earth to punch a small hole in the stone cover he and Ashe had built over the stairway to the surface.  Everyone climbed through the hole into the rainy early morning chill.  Vael cast another Shape Earth to repair the hole in the cover.  They all hiked southeast through the gates of the ruins, to the top of the Long Stair.  There Vael spread the Rug on the ground and the others all used to to teleport back to Gosterwick.  Vael grabbed the Rug and Levitated down the side of the Cliff Face to the secret door, then spread out the Rug and waited for the others to join him.  They then opened the secret door, and Vallium led them in a roundabout march through the southern Great Cavern, east then north they west through side passages, the across the Cavern itself to under the ledge in the southeast corner.  At that point everyone stepped back through the Rug, Vael carried it to the top of the ledge, and everyone came back out.

There was a short passage back into the cave wall, terminating in a 4' high bas-relief of a mostly realistic face of a middle aged man, except with half-spherical empty holes where his eyes should be.  A careful inspection of the face showed that it was magical, and that there were lines around the edges as if it were a door, but it would not open.  Vallium compared the eye holes to various small objects he was carrying, then stepped back through the Rug to the Arcane Practitioners Club in Gosterwick and came back with a pouch full of additional coins and gems, and compared each of them to the eye holes without actually inserting them.  The eyes were too spherical and deep for coins, and too perfectly round to be a good match for most gems, but the silver and blue magical eyes they had were a perfect match.  Vallium said those eyes were valuable and he didn't want to risk losing them without knowing more, so he recommended not actually inserting them yet.  They resolved to come back later when they learned more.

Everyone stepped back through the Rug, and Vael flew it over to the Set landing, then everyone came back out to investigate.  The Settites were still gone.  The group went west, then north, then down a stairway to the west.  Vallium carefully crept ahead in case there were more guards in the octagonal room, but it was empty.  He led them west to the blue pillar, then north from there to a very long staircase down.

The stairs debouched into a room on the Arden level, containing a large construct with the face of Arden and two large hammers, and a large number of corpses of various ages and types but with similar large hammer dents.  Vallium held up his platinum token of Arden.  The construct watched him but did not attack or say anything.  Vallium went to the door in the south of the room, which had previously been deformed with a Shape Earth spell to the point where it was now a crawlway.  He inserted the token into the slot in the door, then crawled through the hole.  The construct appeared satisfied by the ritutal of inserting the token and let him and his companions pass.

Vallium led the group south and east and north around some descending and turning stairs, then north past the large Continually Lit chamber dedicated to Arden, then east past the room with the hot bath, then north over a small barricade with a lot of old corpses, then finally east to the room with 19 beautiful statues of Archontean worthies, and one destroyed statue.  From there a hole in the wall led to a rough narrow passage heading south.  Vallium led the company past a stairway leading up to the west, past some side passages, into a Rudishva-looking passage with while marble floors and walls.  The floor was scorched and bent as though someone had set off a huge fireball here.  There was a circular door at the end of the passage, which Vallium wanted to try opening with the Rudishva oval cards.

While he advanced to try the door, a couple of the earth elementals they had encountered before somehow snuck up behind the group and attacked Ioannes and Vael in the back.  Lacrymosa was caught off guard and took a second to recover her wits.  Meanwhile, Ioannes and Vael each took a couple of heavy blows from stone hands.  Neither quite went down though.  Uvash spun and cast a Stop Bleeding spell on the injured Vael, as Vael activated Larel's Cloak to become invisible then hid against the wall.  Ioannes dove forward away from the elementals to hide behind Uvash, as Vallium heard the commotion behind him and ran toward it.  The second elemental tried to tackle Lacrymosa from behind but completely missed and ended up prone on the ground.  Lacrymosa recovered her senses and started putting arrows into the two elementals at high speed, one in the neck, then the other in the foot to ground it then the neck to try to kill it.  Surprisingly, both elementals disappeared into thin air, just as Vael had.  Lacrymosa started firing arrows into likely hiding spots while Vallium ran up and started poking around with his sword, but neither found the elementals.  Vael invisibly nudged Ioannes while identifying himself and asking for some healing.  Ioannes healed Vael and Lacrymosa, Uvash healed Ioannes, and then Lacrymosa advocated finding and killing the elementals before they got away.

First, they decided to spend a few seconds trying to open the door.  None of the large pile of variously colored Rudishva oval key cards they had opened it.  Vael tried a Lockmaster spell, which gave him a bewildering vision of something that was Not A Lock As He Knew Locks.

Giving up on the round door, the group went into the passages to the east looking for the elementals.  They traversed several caverns full of stalactities and stalagmites but saw no sign of the creatures.  Vallium failed to watch his step while peering around a corner looking for danger, and slipped into a pool of water.  With the Ring of Free Action causing him to easily slip through the water, he immediately sunk quite a distance, before righting himself and kicking and reaching the surface.  After telling the others to watch their step, Vallium dove back into the water, while Vael flew around above it.  The sinkhole was about 60' deep, and at the bottom was a fairly rotten and party eaten Rudishva corpse, wearing a mostly intact orange one-piece outfit with articulated arms and legs.  Vallium hauled the body to the surface, then searched it, finding another rust-colored keycard.  Already wet, he decided to make a second dive into the cold water and look for anything else down there, but didn't find anything else.  He surfaced, considered putting the body through the Rug, decided that might annoy the landlords, and put it in the Bag of Holding instead.

They continued exploring the twisting passages, finding no sign of the elementals, but finding two tunnels sloping down, to the north and east.  They took the eastern one and ended up on top of a ledge, covered with large spider webs.  Carefully cutting some webs away, they advanced and saw below them another large cavern full of giant mushrooms.  Vael again had everyone else step through the Rug so he could Levitate down to the cavern floor.  However, they had not noticed a phase spider on the ceiling above them.  As Vael's last companion disppeared into the carpet, the spider decided the odds were in its favor, and pounced on Vael.  Fortunately for Vael, he saw it dropping toward him, and cast Blink to put himself out of reach, several yards out from the ledge.  Also fortunately, he had a Levitation spell on, so this did not cause a painful fall.  The spider looked at Vael, while shaking its hindquarters back and forth like a cat waiting to pounce, but decided the fall was too far.  Vael charged up a lightning spell and threw it at the spider.  The spider phased out of existence to dodge the bolt.  Vael flew away from the ledge, spent a while avoiding any walls or ceilings or the floor in case the spider was there, then eventually decided it was safe to drop the Rug and open it up with an Apportation spell.  A minute later, Vallium stepped through the Rug, followed quickly by the others.  Vael explained the spider attack, but it did not reappear.

They explored the fungal forest, while Ioannes tried to identify mushrooms.  He saw some Aqua Vitae, and some big red mushrooms that might be fatal Red Veil or might be valuable Red Lotus, but since he wasn't sure he recommended not touching them.  They walked northwest to the edge of the cave and spotted some ledges beyond, then went northeast until they spotted a pond.  An island in the center of the pond contained a building, some kind of automated shovels, and a varumani trying to fix something.  Vael tried talking to the Varumani, but either he wasn't friendly or didn't speak Archontean or Mithric or Elvish or any of Vael's several words of Rudishva.  Ioannes cast Gift of Tongues on Vael, and then Vael started speaking Varumani, and the Varumani responded.  He was a miner, this area was Varumani territory, there were some nasty blood eels in the water so they should not go in.  Vael asked where the rest of Varumani territory was, and the Varumani said north.  Vael asked if there was anything dangerous that way, and the Varumani said "teenagers."  The spell ran out and the group headed north.

As they advanced past a large rock formation, some boulders rolled down it in their direction.  They were moving slowly enough to easily dodge.  Vael spotted a couple of varumani on top of the formation, and used a Thunderclap spell to announce his displeasure.  This was unexpectedly effective, as both varumani retreated to the other side of the rock formation and kept it between themselves and the group.  The cavern ended with a cliff at the north edge, with a ledge on top.  Vael flew up, saw a paved path and a round door, then flew back down and had everyone step through the Rug, then flew back up with the Rug and let them step back out.

Before anyone tried the round door, Ioannes started poking around on the north wall and spotted a secret door.  Vael came up and explained that, no, that's not a secret door, that's just a totally normal natural crack in a wall, Ioannes responded by opening the secret door.  Beyond was a short passage, leading to a worked but decaying room.  In the room were several humans, some dressed like wizards and others like warriors.  One of the wizards blustered that "you're not allowed to be here go away."  The Right for Riches company declined.  One of the warriors called for reinforcements, and a couple more warriors and another wizard came into the room from a passage to the west.  Now outnumbered, the Right for Riches company refused to leave and kept asking questions.  The lead wizard decided not to fight, and not to talk further, and led his group back down the passage to the west, but warned them not to follow.

The room contained a small niche on the west wall with a 4' tall statue of a strange 6-armed creature.  Vallium tried lifting the statue, and it was heavy, but he was strong enough to move it a short distance.  He had Vael spread the Rug on the floor, then picked up the statue, stepped onto the Rug, and said the command word to teleport with it back to their apartment, then returned.  While he was filching the statue, the others searched the room for secret doors, and found one on the east wall.  Using the rule "secret doors first" (which is somehow related to "left for loot") they went through.  It led to some stairs up, and ended in a narrow corridor, with a door on the east end and another on the south wall.  The eastern door had a bunch of graffiti on it in a language they didn't know.  Vallium listened at the east door and heard nothing, then at the south door and heard conversation in Archontean.

Vael knocked on the south door.  It opened a minute later, and there were several humans inside, again dressed as a mix of wizards and warriors.  The Right for Riches company identified themselves.  The strangers asked if King Weskenim sent them.  Vael said they knew King Wiskenim, they were friends with King Wiskenim, but they were not currently representing him.  The strangers said they were awaiting an audience with the King.  The company left.  Vael wrote down all the graffiti on the east door, then knocked on the south door, and asked the wizard if he could read it.  The wizard explained that it was in goblin and that it said "danger," "keep out," "death within," etc.  Vael asked if they knew how to get from here to the King, and the wizard pointed at the ceiling and said the hole there led to the goblin halls, if they could Levitate or climb.

Leaving the mysterious strangers again, the party decided not to open the eastern door, but explored the hallway all the way to the west, where it had collapsed.  They saw a skeleton poking out from the rubble, so dug it out.  The skeleton had been stripped of all equipment, but there was a magic spear behind it, which they took.

They went back to the hole in the ceiling.  Vael Levitated up through it, and saw a small passage leading north, to a huge cave with a lot of noise and the smell of goblins and goats.  When he moved forward to check it out, he saw two ogre guards flanking the end of the passage.  One looked at him and said "Halfling Slayer, you may pass."  Vael went back for the others, and they used a rope to climb up to the hole, then emerged into the Goblin Great Hall.

Vallium walked over to the Merchant's Corner in the southeast of the Hall, and introduced himself to Temrin, the goblin artist sitting waiting for customers.  He asked what Temrin painted, and Temrin said he mostly did portraits, but pointed at Vallium's Halfling Slayer patch and said that he'd made those for the King.  Vallium said Termin's work was excellent and asked if he could paint a portrait of their group.  Temrin agreed, and Vallium then used his Ring of Change Self to appear to be Michael and asked Temrin to add Michael to the portrait.  After about an hour, the portrait was finished, and Vallium purchased it.  He complimented the work and asked if Temrin had any other art for sale.  Temrin had a portrait of King Weskenim and another of Gribble, both of which Vallium also purchased.  He asked what else Temrin could draw, and Temrin said he could do maps and sometimes they turned out to actually lead to the object, but sometimes they didn't.  This got Vallium's attention so he asked Temrin to draw him a map to a necklace with "Nyema" on it.  Temrin started drawing and said it should be ready tomorrow. Vael cast Seeker looking for Nyema's necklace and saw a vision of a necklace hanging on a hook on a wall, somewhere down and to the east.  Vallium paid him for all of the art and said they would be back for the map.

Meanwhile Uvash spotted a group of dwarves, accompanied by a war dog, buying provisions from another merchant.  The dwarves were the Survivors of the Stone, an adventuring party, looking for "something of ours but I can't say what."  Their dog was named Ummchark, which meant "chisel" in Dwarvish.  Vael tried petting the dog without asking and almost became a chew toy, but its owner Ljot called the dog off and told it to go stand next to a goat and not eat it either.  Uvash mentioned they had found a life-stone and asked if any of the dwarves knew the Corundum clan, but they did not.  One of the dwarves, Hallsted, another cleric of Zodarrim, said that he would be happy to take the life-stone back to Kazildor if they finished their mission and headed back that way before Uvash did.  He would look for Uvash at the House of the Gods in Gosterwick before they left the area.

Another merchant, an arms dealer named Claudine, had been watching the interactions.  Vael went over to check on her weapons, but was not impressed with any of them.  Claudine was equally not impressed with Vael.  Vallium also came over to look, and Claudine liked his scale armor and magic sword, but he didn't see anything he wanted to buy either.

The group left the merchants and headed up the spiral stairs to the northeast, past Rizzit the weird purple wax demon, and around the upper level of Goblintown toward King Weskenim's rooms.  When they reached the Court, the major-domo Palestrim recognized them and asked what they wanted.  Vael indicated they would like to see the King.  Palestrim asked if they had news of the Scepter of the Goblins, and Vael said not yet.  It took most of an hour to get their audience, then the king deigned to speak to them for a few minutes.  He said they were doing great work, but he needed that Scepter to unify the goblins.  Vael asked about the secretive wizards, and Weskenim said he was letting them wait in that out-of-the-way room rather than granting an audience, as he thought they were opposed to the Varumani and he didn't really want to make any powerful enemies right now.  He wasn't granting or refusing an audience, just stalling and hoping they went away.  Lacrymosa mentioned that she'd been part of the Great Reconquest of Upper Goblintown but had never received her patch, so Weskenim instructed Palestrim to find her patch, and Palestrim found it in a drawer somewhere so the king could pin it on her and recognize her as an official Halfling Slayer.

With their audience finished, the group went back down the stairs to the Goblin Great Hall, then back down the hole to the southern corridor, then down the secret stairs to the Varumani level.  They followed a passage north, and found a guard room with four varumani guards.  The guards asked if they had varumani passports.  They did not have passports.  The guard said they could not enter varumani territory without a passport.  Vael asked where to get one, and the guard was not very helpful, except for allowing them to leave.  Behind the guards in the room were some small creatures resembling a cross between monkeys and bats, who did not talk, but chirped.

They went back south, then went east to the round door.  Vallium's brown ID did not open it, but Vael's orange ID did.  Beyond was a hallway with two huge stone thrones with leather throws over the backs.  One of the seats had a Rusishva-looking glyph; the other was damaged as though the glyph had been destroyed.  Vael wrote down the glyph on a piece of paper for later investigation.  They continued to the end of the hall, where there was an octagonal room full of trash, and some wide stairs up.

The stairs led to another large corridor, containing a bar run by a varumani and 3 goblins.  Vael purchased a Hak's Special Red Ale.  Ioannes purchased a mushroom cake and got a free cup of water.  The varumani was named Hal, and spoke pretty good Archontean.  He said this was the Arena level and on match days this bar did great business, but it was pretty quiet right now.  There was another set of stairs up to the east, and a chasm to the west with a makeshift bridge going southwest.  Vael asked Hal if that chasm was The Great Chasm, and Hal said he didn't go into the chasm because it wasn't safe, but he'd heard they were connected.

After finishing their snack, the group headed north.  They spied some more large and creepy stone chairs, then some guard niches full of human arena guards, then a room with some gamblers loitering.  Vael spoke to a colorfully dressed varumani tout named Keth, who said tomorrow's matchups were not announced yet so odds were not yet posted, but they were hoping the announcement would come soon.  West of the gamblers were some bleachers overlooking the a huge arena with a sandy floor, currently empty.  There was a door to the northwest, which someone tried opening, but a guard ran out and said "that's private don't go in there" then said something to another guard about how stupid people were about not knowing where not to go.  The second guard said something about maybe putting up helpful signs, and the first guard said something about signs not working because stupid people couldn't read, as the group pretended not to hear the guards and walked away north.

They passed some kind of tunnel bored into the east wall, then reached a fancy throne to the north.  The throne was unoccupied, but some familiar adventurers were hanging in punishment stocks near the throne.  It was Dalton's Darlings, the entire group, including their friend Jost who they had rescued from Gerrilad's jail.  Dalton revealed that they had fought in an arena battle the day before, and the rules were no magic, so they had obeyed by not even bringing their wizard to the fight since he was useless without spells.  But unfortunately Isidor the halfling got injured and reflexively fast-drew and chugged a healing potion, and healing potions were considered magic, so the Arena Lord had stopped the bout, ruled that Dalton's Darlings were cheating, awarded the win to the goblins they were fighting, and ruled that since it was a first offence and they were stupid surfacers who didn't know anything, Dalton's Darlings could spend a few days in the stocks rather than being immediately executed.  The Right for Riches company started asking Dalton more questions, but an arena guard walked up and said "no talking to the prisoners" so they left.

They continued west down a wide passage, past a statue of a four-armed monster and a statue of a Rudishva (who welcomed visitors to the Arena in Archontean, Varumani, and Rudishva), past some magical darkness, and finally west to the Great Chasm, where they saw a huge contraption operated by one varumani in charge and two varumani laborers turning the winch, the Troll Lifts.  The lead varumani said it cost one silver per leg, since there were five of them and they each had two legs, that would be ten silver.  From here they could go up, or across the Chasm, where there was another lift that went down.  They paid the ten silver to go up.  They got in the cage, and the two varumani turned the winch and hoisted them up a long way, until they arrived a level up.  There they met another crew of a varumani overseer and two winch pullers, who let them out of the cage.  Nearby they saw a bridge across the Chasm, with a gap in the middle, and some wooden planks across the gap.

Recognizing about where they were, Vael cast Seek Earth looking for platinum and sensed some nearby, in the varumani lift operators' camp.  Not wanting conflict with them, he tried again, and found more platinum further north somewhere out of sight.  They crossed the bridge and Vael cast Seek Earth for both gold and platinum, and sensed platinum north and gold south.  Giving up for now, they went southwest and found Killick and his large group of goblins.  Killik greeted them and allowed safe passage through his territory to Gog's cave.  Gog greeted them, hoping they'd brought him food, and was disappointed they had not.  He still allowed them through his cave to the secret door leading to stairs up to Upper Goblintown.  The party went up the stairs, through Upper Goblintown, up the stairs through the Pyramid of Thoth, and then back across the surface ruins of Arden Vul to the Beacon.  There Vael asked everyone to step through the Rug, then experimented with Blinking through the cover over their stairs, to the Beacon, rather than using Shape Earth to dig a hole.  He succeeded, and was through with less work.  He laid the Rug down in the Beacon so the others could come through.


GM's Comments:


They failed to open either of the doors they wanted to open, got ambushed twice, and only found a few items of loot.  Yet this was a very successful session in terms of exploration.  They survived both ambushes, explored a whole lot of rooms, found two Arden Vul Iconic Locatons, and visited two previously unvisited levels.


XP:
Exploration: 35 new locations (a new record), good for 2 XP
Loot: not much, but the magic spear is worth enough to generate 1 XP if sold
Achievements: Two Arden Vul Iconic Locations, the Arena and the Sundered Span, for 2 XP
Total: 5 XP

Next Week:

The current plan is to bring food to Gog and see if he can tell them how to get Varumani Passports.  They would then return to Goblintown and get their map from Temrin, and follow it and see if it takes them to Nyema's necklace.  If so, they would recover it and bring it to Yrtol.  If not, they would improvise.
