# DFRPG Arden Vul Session 22: The Oracle of Thoth and The Litany of Light

Date: 
Basilsday, 9nd of Gerakios, 2993 AE 


Weather: 

Hot, dry


Player Characters: 

Vael Sunshadow, Half-Elven mage (Kyle)
Vallium Halcyon, Archontean fighter (Greybrown)
Ioannes Grammatikos Byzantios, Archontean cleric of Demma (Demented Avenger)
Merenuithiel "Lacrymosa" Armaris, Elven mercenary archer (Archon Shiva)


Significant NPCs:

6 ghouls
Yamki, wounded giant 4-armed intelligent baboon
Many large albino baboons
Anaximander, ancient insane cleric of Mitra
Voice of Thoth, ancient god for magic, moons, secrets, etc.
Skeleton cook
Flaming skull
Animated bust of Stamelis, Librarian of Thoth
2 Ibis constructs of Thoth


Ioannes did some research on the copy of the Litany of Light they had found in the Library of Thoth, which pointed to it being a forgery, so he wasn't sure if it was a good idea.  Vael learned the location spells Seeker, Pathfinder, and Trace, and tried using them to find the Troll Lifts and Lillian the missing cleric of Mitra.  Vallium tried and failed to find some magic scale armor, and decided not to put down a deposit on fine-quality scale armor.

Vallium decided the company should try to finish exploring the Well of Light level (except the caves full of baboons), try installing the mirror below the Well of Light, and have Ioannes conduct the Litany of Light if willing and able.  Michael was still off in the mountains somewhere and Uvash had a church emergency, so the shorthanded party hired Lacrymosa the bloodthirsty elf archer.  She asked if it was time to kill the halflings yet, then came along to kill whatever else they needed her to kill.

They got up early on a sunny Basilsday, made good time to the cliff face beneath Arden Vul, then tied themselves together and climbed up the Long Stair (except Vael, who didn't believe in climbing when you could Levitate).  They made it to the top without any problems and hiked to the top of the Well of Light.  Vael cast Flight on Vallium, who carried Ioannes down the Well, while Vael Levitated down and Lacrymosa used Walk on Air to walk down the well as if there were an invisible spiral staircase.  This time, there were no baboon hordes waiting for them at the bottom, so they were able to rest safely.

They went west, then north, and found a door that was spiked shut.  They prepared for battle and Vallium ripped the spikes out.  Opening the door revealed 6 angry ghouls.  A quick fight ensued, where Vallium stabbed the ghouls, Lacrymosa show the ghouls, Ioannes finished off one ghoul with his axe, and Vael supervised while preparing a Great Haste spell just in case they needed it.  They did not.  Digging through the trash in the room found a few platinum coins, a tall bronze magic helmet shaped like an inverted flowerpot, and a wand.  They grabbed the treasure, unspiked a second door into the room for good measure, then continued exploring north and west.

Eventually they doubled back and explored south and west.  They found an empty room, then a room with Continual Light, a fresco of an ibis with orange glowing eyes, a scroll along the wall full of obscure phrases in Mithric, and three blocks of granite shaped like open mouths, with black holes of magical darkness.  They explored the room for a while, until the ibis's eyes flashed and a burst of energy filled the chamber, dispelling all their spells (including all their Blesses, all their Continual Light rocks, and Vael's Levitation) and destroying some of their potions.

After depositing their surviving potions outside the room in case that reoccurred, Vael cast a Light spell into the air, then cast Trace on his Returning Pebble and threw it into the eastern mouth.  He sensed that it teleported way down and northeast, then was still.  A few minutes later, the dispelling effect repeated, taking out both the Light and the Trace.  The Returning Pebble eventually returned, and Vael returned the experiment with the middle mouth.  This time the pebble went down and in the direction he threw it, as if there were stairs or a ramp there.  He waited until the second Trace was dispelled and the Pebble reappeared in his pocket, then returned the experiment with the western mouth.  This one seemed like another teleporter, moving the stone down and southeast.

Meanwhile, Ioannes, re-cast Bless on his other companions, who stayed out of the room to keep from having it dispelled again.  He finally cast it on Vael, and then everyone crawled into the magical mouth.  After going through a brief area of magical Darkness and Silence, they emerged onto narrow stairs leading down, then the passage turned west and they went down some more, until they reached a dead end with a square hole in the ceiling.  Vael re-cast Levitation and popped up into a hemispherical room containing an dais with a magical marble chair and a ibis statue whose wings wrapped around the chair.  In the chair sat a very old, disheveled man who was twitching and mumbling.

Everyone climbed up into the room.  The man did not respond.  Everyone tried talking to him, but he did not respond.  Eventually Vallium pulled the man out of the chair, and then the man noticed them, but did not speak coherently, just babbled about things they mostly did not understand.  It took a lot of prodding to reveal that his name was Anaximander, he was a cleric of Mitra, and he'd been in that chair for a very long time.  Ioannes told the others to pull him out if anything weird happened, then sat in the chair.  He felt a warm layer of air, then a deep voice told him to "Speak Thy Desire."  Ioannes said that he wanted to know the correct way to perform the Litany of Light.  The voice told him that he already had a book that said exactly how to do it, and that instructions could not get much more detailed that that, but maybe he could find a version with more pictures.  Ioannes was then stunned.  After a couple of minutes, Vallium pulled Ioannes out of the chair, and he soon recovered.

The old guy asked a few jealous questions about how Ioannes had gotten answers and said maybe it was a good idea to bring friends along to pull him out of the chair.  While he rocked on the floor, the group went out an exit to the south, into a room with a magic pool, whose water was overflowing the basin and streaming out of the room to the southeast.  Vael cast Analyze Magic, which said that the pool was designed to increase its user's intelligence.  That was enough for Ioannes, who immediately took a drink and felt smarter.  Impressed, Vael also took a drink, but felt sicker rather than smarter, then felt his guts twisting.  Ioannes cast a couple of Stop Bleeding spells and a Major Healing on Vael to help repair the damage, and the poisoning eventually subsided.  Vallium explored the water damage crack, but it wasn't big enough to go far, and he didn't find anything in the water.

Returning to the Oracle room, the group grabbed Anaximander and headed back up the stairs.  They left the dispelling room before it got another chance to ruin their spells, and headed for the Library of Thoth.  There they introduced Anaximander to the animated bust of Stemelis, and let the two ancient guys keep each other company while they explored more.

Vael found a secret door north of the kitchen, which led to a dusty narrow corridor.  In the corridor was a skeleton with a chef's hat and a cleaver, who was angry at the intrusion.  He was only one skeleton though, and Vallium and Lacrymosa finished him off pretty quickly.  The skeleton had a scroll in its hand that turned out to be a recipe for baboon stew, which they took.  Continuing east, they found another secret door at the other end of the passage which led to an area north of the baboon cave.  They saw Yamki, the giant 4-armed baboon they had wounded before, leaning on a stick, standing in the entrance to the cave watching them.  Neither side made any threatening moves, and the group moved away from the baboons.

They went north to a room with a baboon statue and a door they had not tried before.  The door had a picture of an ear on it, so everyone listened to it, but heard nothing.  It was locked, and Vallium pulled out his collection of keys.  The first one he tried fit, and he unlocked the door, but a needle trap was triggered.  He pulled his hand out of the way in time to avoid being pricked, if there was ever any chance of the needle penetrating his armored gauntlets.  After some brief discussion of whether they could try to recover poison from the needle, they decided the risk to reward ratio was poor, and Vallium carefully broke off the needle and threw it into a corner.

The room to the north was large, with columns, a dais in the center, and an opening to the Great Chasm to the east.  Vallium checked out the chasm, while Ioannes and Vael looked at the dais.  There was an ivory oliphant, and a Mithric note that said to "Name Thyself and Whisper They Message and Thou Shalt Be Rewarded in Thine Ear."  Vael complied, but the message he received was some stupid song about 99 flagons of ale on the wall.  Ioannes also tried, and heard a very deep voice saying "Me hide pretty rock in water.  Nobody find it now!"

Looking over the chasm, Vael thought he saw something to the southeast.  He Levitated over the chasm to inspect a creepy magical soapstone idol of some kind of salamander, with empty eye sockets and a gaping mouth.  He came back and cast Flight on Vallium so that Vallium could carry the others over the chasm.  They avoided the statue and explored a cave filled about 3 feet deep in bones.  After not finding anything in the bones for a few minutes, Vael searched for secret doors, and found a concealed exit to the east.   He then cast Seek Magic, then Seek Earth twice, for gold and platinum.  When these spells revealed nothing in this room and platinum off to the east, he suggested they stop searching and go east.

It led to a large round cavern, with a shaft in the middle, in which there was a huge creepy triangular obelisk, clearly crafted not natural.  The obelisk continued up about 20' above their heads, and down farther than their Continual Light went.  Vael Levitated up to the top of the obelisk and saw a pentagram on top, with a metal coffer within the pentagram.  He avoided touching the pentagram and tried Apportating the coffer open, but it appeared to be welded shut.  He looked at the pentagram to see if it looked like platinum, but it looked more like silver to him.  

Vael flew back down, informed the others, then flew down the obelisk about 90' without seeing the bottom.  Not wanting to stray too far, he flew back up, cast Trace on his Returning Pebble, and dropped it.  It fell about 150' before stopping.  Vael then flew down to the bottom and found the obelisk sat in a natural cave, with nothing very interesting within range of his light.  Not wanting to explore solo, he returned to the others.

Leaving the obelisk, they went north down a narrow tunnel until they found two bodies, one wearing slightly glowing orange mail, in front of a stone chest.  As they inspected the bodies, a flaming skull flew out of the wall to attack Vallium.  He parried, and a quick combat ensued, where Vallium kept stabbing it (while not doing much damage, as his sword mostly passed through the flames) and Lacrymosa tried both arrows and her cloak.  Eventually Vallium scored three critical hits in a row and the skull was dispelled.  They searched the bodies and found a small magic silver eye, a few coins, a scroll, and a couple of potions.

Iaonnes went to open the chest but Vael yelled him away and tried using Apportation instead.  That failed because the chest was locked.  Vael thought he noticed some writing on the chest and cautioned the others against reading it.  Eventually he opened the chest with a Lockmaster spell followed by an Apportation, without setting off any traps.  Inside the chest were a bunch of silver coins, a few of the extremely valuable huge ancient octagonal platinum coins, a magic silver torc, another copy of the Litany of Light (this one much shorter and less fancy than the one from the library), a magic pick, and a few potions.

With their desire for treasure temporarily met, they went back to the Well of Light to try replacing the mirror and saying the Litany of Light.  Vael cast Flight on Vallium again so he could ferry the others across the chasm, and then everyone went back to the library.  Stamelis looked ready to have Anaximander taken off his hands, then was disappointed when Vallium just grabbed the huge mirror from behind the stacks and went right back out the door.  Vallium maneuvered the mirror onto the tripod while Vael and Ioannes gave helpful hints.  Eventually they placed it correctly and light went out in all directions, then Vael went to play with some of the secondary mirrors and bounce the light around.

With the mirror in place, Ioannes conducted the Litany of Light.  He went to the four small rooms surrounding the Well of Light, and in each room said the correct Mithric words.  His poor Mithric pronunciation was just good enough to trigger each effect, and he ended up with Infravision, an intelligence bonus, See Secrets, and Invisibility.  Vael and Vallium followed him around and repeated the rituals, and each of them got the same bonuses.  Lacrymosa did not participate.  With See Secrets in effect, everyone started running around looking for secret doors.  They found one northeast of the Ruby Chair, and another one northwest.

They opened the secret door northeast of the Ruby Chair (with the hidden catch on the floor made obvious by Thoth's blessing) and went east into a room, with an apparently accurate magically animated star field on the ceiling (despite it being daytime outside), and a couple of mosaics, one depicting the room with the Ruby Chair, another depicting some unknown large room with a bunch of statues.  They continued east to find a room with a couple of corpses, which Ioannes thought had been killed by some kind of strong impaling damage.  Both were wearing red ceremonial robes and hats.  One had a belt pouch, which they took without opening.  Another was lying on a big bronze key.  One was wearing magic boots.  They took all the loot but left the old rotted robes and hats.

Continuing east, they found a room containing two ibis statues.  The statues unfortunately did not seem to like visitors, and animated and attacked Lacrymosa, the only visible intruder.  Looking at their beaks, Ioannes now had a pretty good idea how the corpses to the west had been impaled.  Invisible Vallium had a free shot at the back of one of the constructs, and hit it squarely, but not hard enough to take it down.  Lacrymosa ran away while rapidly firing arrows, which the other construct dodged with amazing speed.  Ioannes and Vael tried to stay out of the way and stay Invisible.  After a few more tries, Lacrymosa finally managed to nail one of the constructs in the leg, slowing it and knocking it down.  It didn't dodge so well after that, and stopped moving after a few more arrows hit it.  Meanwhile Vallium landed a second, harder hit on the other ibis to slow it, then finished it off.  With See Secrets still running, everyone noticed a secret door on the south wall behind where one of the constructs had been standing, but nobody opened it.

In a hurry to go home, the party took a quick look to the east and saw a dead-end room with some spiral stairs down.  They then doubled back, closing the secret door behind them.  They went back to the Library, retrieved Anaximander, then went back to Gosterwick.  Vallium took Anaximander to the Temple of Mitra to see if they could help him, while Vael and Ioannes went back to the Arcane Practitioners Club to start identifying their loot.



GM's Comments:


That was an exceptionally productive delve.  All the previous visits to the Well of Light level had been interrupted by periodic baboon attacks, but with the baboons apparently herded into the Howling Caves to the southeast, there were fewer interruptions this time, which made exploration easier.

Using a Trace spell on the Returning Pebble was a creative way to figure out what the 3 dark mouths did, without actually risking crawling in.  Vael used a lot of caution this session, not touching the salamander statue or the pentagram on top of the obelisk, and trying to open every container with Apportation rather than his hands, but still got poisoned by the magic pool.

Anaximander seemed too crazy to give the party useful information, but Ioannes still dared climbing into the marble chair that they pulled Anaximander out of, and got an answer about the Litany of Light.

Replacing the mirror and performing the Litany of Light correctly got four useful magical effects with long (but not permanent) durations.  See Secrets revealed three secret doors, two in areas the group had walked past before without searching.  And Invisibility gave Vallium a free rear attack on the ibis construct, which contributed to quickly winning that battle.


Achievements:
The Rescuers: 1 XP for pulling Anaximander out of the Oracle of Thoth and bringing him back to town
The Litany of Light: 1 XP for restoring the mirror and performing the full Litany

XP:
Exploration: About 17 new locations, 1 XP
Loot: A few magic items plus 5 of those valuable huge ancient platinum coins, 2 XP
Achievements: 2 XP
Total: 5 XP

Next week:

They left a couple of secret doors and a staircase unexplored at the end of the session, so they'll probably be back.  Though there was some talk of trying to rescue Lillian, the canon of the Temple of Mitra in Newmarket, now that Vael has some knowledge magic that might make it easier to find her.  (Of course there was also talk of killing Plumthorn's halflings, but pretty much only from Lacrymosa, who always wants to kill the halflings.)

DFRPG Arden Vul Session 23a: Gelatinous Cube and Slime Kraken
Date: 
Basilsday, 16th of Gerakios, 2993 AE 


Weather: 

Hot, dry


Player Characters: 

Vael Sunshadow, Half-Elven mage (Kyle)
Vallium Halcyon, Archontean fighter (Greybrown)
Ioannes Grammatikos Byzantios, Archontean cleric of Demma (Demented Avenger)
Michael J. Dundee, Thorcin barbarian (Adam)
Uvash Edzuson, Dwarven cleric of Zodarrim (Cosmo)


Significant NPCs:

Lillian, captured Canon of Mitra
Kronos, Innkeeper at the Sign of the Broken Head
4 Ghouls
Gelatinous Cube
Slime Kraken
Susarra, Archontean fighter
Several Set guards


Vallium formulated a plan to rescue Lillian.  They would avoid the halflings, bribe the beastmen (who rumor claimed had taken Lillian) with food for information on Lillian or for her release, bring her back to the Church of Mitra, and profit.

The first part of the plan went pretty well.  They loaded up their mule with food and took it up to the ruins of Arden Vul.  Not wanting to take the mule into the Halls, they instead took it to the Sign of the Broken Head and paid Kronos for boarding.  They then loaded the food into a wheelbarrow, went down through the basement entrance to avoid the halflings, and headed south toward the beastmen.

On the way, they searched for secret doors in the Thothian burial niches, and found one.  Opening it up found a crypt containing some elaborate sarcophagi and 4 angry ghouls.  The ghouls surprised Michael, but failed to hurt him.  A quick battle ensued, with Michael and Vallium smacking down the ghouls.  The grave goods included a couple of magical white gold rings, a high quality spear, and some silver torcs and alabaster urns.  The party took the light loot and left the heavy stuff in the secret tomb to grab on the way out.

As they approached beastman territory, Vael cast Seeker looking for Lillian.  The spell showed her bound, gagged, and injured, in a prison cell.  It said the cell was somewhere to the northwest, away from the beastmen.  Vael followed up the Seeker with a Trace so he could keep homing in on Lillian.  At that point they decided to turn around and not talk to the beastmen after all, since it appeared they didn't have Lillian.

They went north and west until they reached the room with 3 portcullises and 3 levers.  Vael, who hadn't been there before, wanted to go up the stairs to the south, but Vallium explained that it led to parts of the Well of Light lever that they had not fully explored, and pulled him back on target.  Vael, not wanting to touch anything he didn't have to, used Apportation to move the middle lever and open the middle portcullis.  They then headed west into a maze of catacombs, filled with burial niches whose plugs had been removed.  Knowing it would take forever to search all the niches, everyone kept their eyes open for obvious doors or treasure, but nobody took time to search.

At one point Uvash was in the lead and almost ran right into a nearly invisible form ahead.  He saw some coins just hanging in the air, and stopped before becoming enveloped.  It was a large gelatinous cube.  Uvash backed away and called for help, as the others ran up.  The cube was huge but fairly slow.  Uvash was a bit worried that it might damage his fancy mace, but took a swing at it anyway, and did a bit of damage.  Michael and Vallium ran up and started rapidly hacking at it.  It kept trying to hit them with slimy pseudopods, but didn't aim very well.  Eventually they hit it enough that it slowed down further and stopped dodging effectively, and then they just kept hitting it until it stopped twitching.

There were some coins and gems inside the cube's body, along with a wand.  Michael, wearing heavy armor and a Ring of Free Action, was able to crawl in and grab the gems and wand without getting hurt, but his armor was smoking a bit.  Manually getting all the coins didn't seem worth the risk, but since coins are pretty sturdy, Vael used Create Fire to just melt the remains of the cube to ash, and they picked the coins out of the remains.

They found a door heading south, but it had no obvious handle, did not budge when they tried pushing it open, and appeared too strong to break down without mining tools.  Vael tried using Apportation to push the door in every direction, but his spell failed to move the door.  Giving up, the group resumed walking around the catacombs looking for secret doors.  Ioannes found one to the northwest, but it led to stairs down, and Vael was pretty sure Lillian was on this level, so they didn't go that way.

Giving up on finding another door, they went back to the heavy door, and Vael used Shape Earth to dig a small tunnel through the rock a few yards away from the door.  His first couple of tries didn't go far enough, but eventually he managed to dig a small tunnel through to another room.  Vallium volunteered to crawl through it first, and didn't find anything dangerous in the room, just the bodies of a couple of humans and a couple of ghouls.  Everyone else crawled in, and they looted a shortsword and a ring.  There was a door on the north wall, which led to a short passage and then the door they had been unable to open from the other side.  From this side, it was possible to push it open with enough effort.  However, it closed itself shortly after they stopped pushing on it, and nobody had any spikes to keep it open.

Heading east, they found another room with doors south and east.  The southern door was spiked shut.  Vael confirmed that Lillian was still southwest, so they pulled the spikes and went south.  They saw doors south and west.  The western room was small and completely trashed.

To the south, however, was a very large room, containing a circular pool with a statue of Thoth inside it.  The temple had been thoroughly and deliberately trashed, and both clerics felt like it was a place of negative sanctity.  There was some anti-Thoth graffiti on the walls, and a picture of a crocodile eating an ibis, indicating that the vandalism was probably the work of Settites.  Worse, when Vallium went into the room, a lot of tentacles emerged from the pool to grab him.  Everyone retreated back north out of the room, with Vallium chopping off a couple of the tentacles as he parried their attacks.

After some discussion, the group decided they needed to get past the tentacle beast, but since they now knew it was there, they could buff themselves first.  Vael would cast Great Haste on the fighters, while Ioannes cast Flaming Weapon.  Vael flubbed his first couple of attempts to Great Haste Michael, but the third try worked, and then Michael opened the door and charged south.  He ran right into the pool, not slowed because of his Ring of Free Action, and started cutting off tentacles as the slime kraken tried dragging him under.  At one point it looked like Michael critically failed an attack and crippled his own shield arm, but his Bless spell sacrificed itself and prevented the self-inflicted attack.  A few seconds later, Vallium also came charging into the room at double speed, and now the slime beast was surrounded.  Both Vallium and Michael kept cutting off tentacles, then went after its body.  With all its tentacles gone, the beast started biting with its beak.  Uvash used Divine Grace then followed them into the room, but Michael finished the slime creature off with multiple rapid strikes from behind before Uvash arrived.

With the battle over, Vael was very tired after casting multiple Great Hastes, and Vallium and Michael were tired from fighting.  While they rested, Ioannes started searching and found a magical sheet of yellow glass in the pool.  Rather than reaching into the murky water, he Apportated it out.  After resting, everyone started circling the room and looking for secret doors.  Vael found a secret door in the north wall, with a small empty alcove behind it.  Later he searched in the same spot on the south wall and found a matching secret door and empty alcove.  There were doors in all four corners of the rooms.  Both of the ones on the east side led to ramps up to galleries overlooking the temple.  One of the ramps had a bit of adventuring equipment left on it, and Vallium grabbed some spikes.

The most promising door, in the southwest corner, led to a small passage south, another door, and a cave-in.  The cave in was large enough that Vael did not feel he could use Shape Earth to get past it.  Everyone returned to the temple and searched again for secret doors.  They did not find any, but Uvash spotted an iron key in the fountain, which Vael Apportated out, dried off, and added to their keyring.

Giving up on manually searching, Vael pulled out the Wand of See Secrets and used a charge.  At that point a secret door to the southwest and a peephole high on the west wall became obvious to him.  He ran around the temple while the spell lasted, finding another secret door off the southeast gallery.  He then doubled back north through the other rooms they had searched.  He did not find any more secret doors there.  There was one door to the east which they had not opened, and, caution thrown aside while racing the spell duration, Vael opened it rather than waiting for Vallium and Michael to catch up.  There was an armed and armored woman hiding in the room.  Fortunately for Vael, she did not attack, and instead asked who he was and what he was doing there.  Vael didn't want to talk, as he was trying to find secret doors, but he explained that they were looking for Lillian.  The woman didn't know who Lillian was, but said that her name was Susarra and her friends had been killed by ghouls and she was looking for a way out past the tentacle monster.  When Vael indicated that they had killed the monster and invited her to tag along, she followed him out of the room.

They listened to the southwestern secret door, opened it, and found a room full of trash.  There were some footprints leading from the secret door to the middle of the room, then vanishing.  Everyone started searching for more secret doors.  While searching, Vallium triggered a spear trap.  It barely penetrated his helmet, scratching his face.  Vallium broke the spear in half to make sure that didn't happen again.  They eventually found a concealed door on the south wall.

When they opened the door, a trap went off, and gas started pouring into the room with a loud hiss.  Everyone managed to hold their breath before breathing any of the gas, and then Vael cast a Purify Air to clear the room.  The group went south through the door, and saw some Set guards in their distinctive red scale armor, looking angry.  There wasn't enough time left in the session to fight the battle, so the session ended there.


GM's Comments:

Slime Kraken might be my new favorite monster name.

Gelatinous Cubes are fun, but they're also slow and stupid, so unless they surprise you and get a free attack, or corner you, they're not as dangerous as they seem.

You would think that the combination of Seeker and Trace and Shape Earth would make reaching a prisoner within one four-hour session pretty easy.  Find the prisoner, head toward the prisoner, and if you can't find a way toward the prisoner, dig one.  But four hours flew by this week, despite only finishing three fights.


Achievements:

None

XP:

None until they get back to down, but they explored some new territory and found a bit of loot.


Next Week:

We know they'll be starting the session fighting those Set guards, and then, if they win, presumably resuming the search for Lillian.


2025-08-23
DFRPG Arden Vul Session 23b: Disrupting Services in the Temple of Set
Date: 
Basilsday, 16th of Gerakios, 2993 AE 


Weather: 

Hot, dry


Player Characters: 

Vael Sunshadow, Half-Elven mage (Kyle)
Vallium Halcyon, Archontean fighter (Greybrown)
Ioannes Grammatikos Byzantios, Archontean cleric of Demma (Demented Avenger)
Michael J. Dundee, Thorcin barbarian (Adam)
Uvash Edzuson, Dwarven cleric of Zodarrim (Cosmo)


Significant NPCs:

Lillian, captured Canon of Mitra
Susarra, Archontean fighter
Many Set guards
Many Set cultists
Several Set acolytes
Several Set deacons

Continuing from the previous session, Vallium came through the gas-trapped doorway, with Vael, Ioannes, and Susarra close behind him.  Uvash and Michael were well behind.  There was one Set guard in red scale armor peering around a corner ahead, shouting back reports to his allies.  Vallium charged, while yelling for nobody to stand right behind him.  The guard waited until Vallium was two yards away to fire his crossbow -- and somehow missed.  Whether this was due to Vallium's Amulet of Missile Shield, or the guard just panicking, was hard to tell.

The guard backed around the corner.  There was a short staircase up, with a 4' tall barricade at the top, and several more guards behind the barricade, holding crossbows.  A couple more took shots at Vallium as he and the first guard ran up the stairs, then dropped their crossbows and pulled out maces or potions.  Meanwhile Michael and Uvash caught up to Vael, who cast Great Haste on Michael.

Vallium neared the barricade as a couple of the guards threw down Alchemist's Fire potions, but missed him.  By then Michael was double-timing up the stairs behind him, and Vael was near the bottom of the steps casting a Grease spell.  The Set deacon at the top of the stairs concentrated on a spell for a couple of seconds, so Vallium let go of his sword (letting it hang from a lanyard), reached into his potion belt, and smashed a Magebane potion.  This emitted a sickly smoke that kept everyone within a few yards of Vallium from casting wizard spells for a while -- but the caster was a cleric and was not affected.  He finished his Dispel Magic spell, catching Vallium and Michael and Susarra in it.  He was trying to dismiss Vallium's Missile Shield (which failed because it was a permanent magic item, not a spell) and Michael's Great Haste.  The attempt was successful, and also dismissed a couple of Continual Light rocks as well as Vallium's Bless.

It didn't get the Grease though, which was cast behind the barricade outside the area of effect of the Dispel, and the guards started slipping and sliding.  Michael stabbed the one on the stairs.  Vallium recovered his sword and hit a couple behind the barricade.  Susarra got to the barricade and got a couple of axe swings in.  As the battle turned against his side, the deacon commanded one of the unwounded guards to run north and set reinforcements.  A badly wounded guard broke ranks and followed him.  After taking a hit, the deacon retreated west.  Uvash reached the top and opened the gate in the barricade, and the party poured through.  They eventually took down all but one of the guards, but the one survivor ran north into an area with a red tiled floor, pulled open a black curtain, and ran into the large room beyond while yelling for help.

Vallium used his Ring of Illusion Disguise to look like the cleric they had just defeated, whose guards had called Deacon Hurub.  He followed the guard into the big temple room to the north while yelling "The Azure Knights are attacking, there are too many, retreat."  A couple of set clerics were leading many cultists in a service nearby.  Many of the cultists broke and ran in various directions.  Vallium waited at the curtain for a few seconds, while Vael cast Great Haste on both Vallium and Michael, and Ioannes followed up with Flaming Weapon.  Once they were fully buffed, everyone ran into the temple.  Michael chased the retreating guard to the west, trailed by Vael, and eventually caught and killed him, but by then about eight more guards were streaming out of two rooms north and south.  Uvash and Ioannes and Susarra went east toward a huge statue of Set in Set animal form, and killed a few cultists.  Vallium chased some clerics to the northeast into a room with a portcullis, and killed them both before they got it open.  There was a brief difference of opinion about who was the real cleric of Set and who was the traitor or imposter, but Vallium won the argument using his sword, and the nearby cultists helped him finish off the acolyte.

Michael was beset by a lot of guards, but he had Great Haste, and Vael cast two Grease spells and a Smoke spell among the guards to help him.  Michael eventually downed all of them.  Meanwhile Susarra ran between two long rectangular pools to come help Michael, when a huge crocodile unexpectedly emerged from one of the pools and tried to eat her.  She avoided being surprised and eventually killed it with a couple of solid axe blows.  A second crocodile came out later, and she wounded it badly enough that it went back under the water to hide and wait for easier prey.

Uvash and Ioannes, after running out of nearby cultists, decided to try to desecrate the evil temple.  Ioannes first tried to knock over the huge statue, but it was just too heavy.  They then decided to take its ruby eyes.  The statue was 25' tall, so its eyes were well out of reach.  Uvash climbed up the statue with his Ring of Climbing, then dropped a rope to help Ioannes up, since Ioannes had the Apportation spell and could take the rubies without actually touching them.  This plan worked, and Ioannes magically grabbed two huge rubies and dropped them in Uvash's pouch, before climbing back down.  Ioannes then stole everything he could find on the Settites' evil sacrificial altar.  He and Uvash then knocked it over.

Vallium chased down and killed two more deacons who were trying to escape down a wide staircase to the west, then dragged them back into the temple and took their portable valuables.  He and Vael shut the huge bronze doors, and Vael Magelocked them.  Vael ran around the room looking for magic items, and Susarra explored the temple looking for other valuables.  Everyone then retreated to the room to the south, outside the temple's Set-aligned sanctity, to rest and heal.  Both Michael and Susarra were fairly wounded, so Ioannes used Stop Bleeding and Major Healing to patch them up.

After the long battle, and with the Set Cult fully alerted to their presence, it was time to decide whether to head back to Gosterwick or press on looking for Lillian.  The group unanimously decided to keep looking for Lillian rather than retreating, so they ended the session, very close to where they started it, but surrounded by a lot of dead Settites (and one dead crocodile).


GM's Comments:

This was by far the biggest battle we've fought in this campaign, 5 PCs and an NPC against over 20 Settites and a couple of crocodiles.  It took almost the whole session.  I should have taken some screenshots.



Achievements:

None


XP:

None until they get back to town, but they explored even more new territory and found some more loot.


Next Week:

They're pretty sure they're close to Lillian now, so they're going to try to rescue her and get out before whatever portion of the Set cult is left gets their revenge.

We resumed in the dungeon, after the party killed or chased off everyone in the Temple of Set and spent a few minutes looting.  The group retreated south out of the temple, back into the guard room atop the barricade, where until the sanctity level (for non-Settites) went back to normal, then rested.  They then searched the western wall, where the Set deacon had been running, and found a door concealed behind a screen.  They went west through a torture chamber, then through a black curtain into some kind of waiting room with pews, then south into a robing room.  There were some red Settite robes there, but not enough for everyone, and Uvash refused to wear them anyway.  With some of the group disguised and some not, they searched for secret doors and found one on the south wall, leading to a narrow spy corridor. Heading west, they found some peepholes into a prison, with seven cells, six prisoners (including Lillian), and four guards.  Without a way into the prison from here, they doubled back north, east, and then south down some stairs.

Suddenly some candles lining the stairs start smoking, and loud screams came from somewhere.  Magically alerted, several guards poured out of a room to the southeast.  A six-on-six battle commenced.  Susarra, Vallium, and Michael filled the corridor to the south, with Uvash, Vael, and Ioannes behind them.  On the other side were 4 Set guards, a Set torturer with a long whip, and a Set wizard who was throwing Force Missiles at Michael from the doorway.




The Set ranks held for a few seconds, while Vael cast Great Haste on Michael.  Then once Michael started attacking twice as fast, he downed an enemy and charged forward to get the wizard, while Uvash moved up to fill the hole on the left.  Vallium and Susarra kept holding the line and stabbing Settites, and Ioannes cast several Stop Bleeding and Major Healing spells to keep his allies up.  As the Settites started to fall, they yelled for help, and reinforcements started coming from the west.  It was the four guards the party had seen before, plus a jailer they had not spotted.




As the original Settites to the east fell, the battle moved west toward the approaching reinforcements.  Vael dropped a Grease spell in the hallway, which resulted in several Settites missing attack or defense rolls or falling over.  Michael, with his Ring of Free Action, was unaffected by the bad footing, and mercilessly hacked through the Settites before his Great Haste could run out.  Susarra and Uvash and Vallium followed behind him, staying out of the Grease but helping finish the Settites.  Eventually, all 11 of the Settites went down.

Vael and Michael were exhausted after the battle, so took a few minutes to rest, with Ioannes casting Lend Energy.  Once everyone could stand up, they took a preliminary pass over the bodies looking for magical loot, then they went west.  They heard a woman yelling from behind an open door to the north.  In the room was the jailer's prisoner Eadgithu, manacled to the wall.  Vallium grabbed the jailer's key ring and tried keys until one freed her, at which point Eadgithu thanked them and went to grab a sword off the jailer's body.  Vael saw a lockbox in the room and cautiously opened it using the keys and an Apportation spell, finding some coins and gems and a spellbook.  The group then went west to the prison.

There were 6 prisoners visible.  Three of them (Lillian, an overweight man, and a tough-looking man) were manacled to the back of their cells and gagged.  The other three (a goblin, a fishman, and a well-muscled dwarf) were not tied or gagged.  Half of the prisoners showed obvious wounds, while the others appeared to be in better shape.  Vallium used the jailer's keys to free Lillian first, and Ioannes healed her wounds.  She then explained who some of the other prisoners were.  She said the tough-looking man was Azgallatu, a warrior cleric of Mitra who had been captured trying to find her, and he should definitely be freed.  She stated that the goblin (who showed no wounds) was some high-ranking noble captive, at which point Gribble interrupted to introduce himself and said he was the brother of King Wiskenim, who would certainly reward his rescuers.  Lillian and Gribble agreed that the fishman was unfriendly and also didn't seem to speak any languages they knew, so he was left in his cell.  The overweight man was Geleg, a wizard, who when ungagged immediately thanked his rescuers then asked if anyone had seen his spellbook.  Vael admitted to having found a spellbook but asked if he could copy any spells, and Geleg immediately agreed to let Vael copy anything he wanted.  The dwarf seemed a bit unfriendly, so Vallium passed the keys to Uvash to deal with him.  Grist asked Uvash several questions, apparently suspicious that he might be a doppleganger, before agreeing that he was an actual dwarf and warming up slightly.  He was badly wounded, so he appreciated the healing spell Ioannes gave him.  Azgallatu, when freed, thanked the party then immediately took up position at Lillian's side.

With a horde of rescued prisoners in tow, the party went back east to loot the room at the bottom of the stairs.  There were several heads mounted on the walls, of a lion, some kind of reptile man, a member of Gog's species, and a goblin.  The goblin head appeared to be magical.  Gribble wanted to throw it in a nearby disposal hole, but because it was magical Vael argued that it couldn't be left where the Settites could recover it, so Gribble reluctantly put it in a chest (where he didn't have to look at it) and carried it out.  Meanwhile each of the other prisoners was asked to carry a suit of red Set scale armor.  So burdened, the group went back north up the stairs, east over the barricade, north through the gas-trapped room (the trap had not reset), and back into the desecrated temple of Thoth were the slime kraken had been killed.

There was some debate on whether to go north or east.  Vallium argued that east was closer to the halflings so north was safer.  Ioannes countered that with so many of them, the halflings would probably be too scared to fight.  But the decision was made to go north and try to avoid contact.  Vael re-cast Shape Earth to cover the ends of the passage he had made next to the one-way door, and everyone went north through the one-way door then east through the catacombs to the portcullis.  They closed the portcullis behind them, then went south through the burial niches to the secret room where they had stashed a wheelbarrow full of food.

Vael and Vallium wanted to give the food to someone rather than waste it, so they asked Lillian the story of her capture.  She said she had been looking for Settite activity when she had been grabbed by the Green Fang Kobolds, who traded her to the beastmen, who traded her to the Settites, who threw her in their jail and tortured her.  This dropped everyone's opinion of the beastmen, and they decided to give the food to Gog instead of the beastmen.  They instructed everyone to leave the heavy scale armor in the secret door, grabbed the wheelbarrow of food, and headed south and east to the concealed door behind the baboon fresco.  They took the hidden stairs down to the Cave of Gog.

Gog heard them coming, and was waiting outside the secret door when it opened.  He was pleased to see the wheelbarrow of food and asked if it was for him.  Pleased to hear that he was, he got his boat and had them dump all the food from the wheelbarrow into it.  Gribble said that goblin territory was just to the south and asked if the party would like to meet his brother the king.  The other freed prisoners were not so enthusiastic about tromping through goblin territory, but they didn't want to go back to Gosterwick without their heavily armed escort either, so they came along.  Gribble led them south into a room full of many goblins, who enthusiastically greeted him.  Their leader led Gribble and his huge entourage east to Killik, the Boss of the Wet Caves.  Killik then appointed one of the other goblin captains Temporary Boss and went with Gribble down a long staircase to Goblintown.

Arriving in Goblintown, Killik and Gribble led the party through a confusing maze of passages.  At one point they were led across a rickety bridge "maybe not so strong for big people go one at a time."  Uvash actually broke one slat of the bridge when crossing it, but managed not to fall.  They eventually reached a room with ogre guards outside, where the goblin major-domo, Pelestrim, greeted Gribble and went into the room to arrange an audience.  A minute later, Gribble and his rescuers were invited in to meet King Weskenim.

King Weskenim asked Gribble a lot of questions in Goblin, then thanked his rescuers in accented Archontean, and said he wasn't prepared for their arrival but promised them a reward next time they visited.  He also mentioned the need to recover the Scepter of the Goblins.  When Vael asked if the goblins knew about any other entrances to the Halls, Weskenim said that was a sore point, that Plumthorn's Halflings were squatting on his rightful entrance to the surface, and needed to be removed.  After hearing how many Settites they had killed, he said the Right for Riches company were just the halfling exterminators he needed and to please take care of the infestation at their earliest convenience.  He warned them that the halflings had a wizard and used poison.  At some point during the meeting, Weskenim's cat jumped onto his shoulder, at which point the king had to end the meeting to play with the cat.

With the royal audience concluded, Killik led the party and their freed prisoners back up to the Wet Caves, this time taking a longer route that didn't involve any bridges that might not be strong enough for armored humans or dwarves.  At one point he rushed them past some kind of demon imprisoned in a summoning circle reciting obscure mathematical formulae, but didn't answer any questions.  They went back up to the Wet Caves, then back to Gog's Cave, where Gog was happily sorting his newly acquired food.  Gog ferried everyone across the underground stream in his boat, and they went upstairs, then out to the surface through the basement exit, then back to the Broken Head to get their mule, then back to the dam to stow their wheelbarrow, then finally back to Gosterwick.

In Gosterwick, Jador the Just at the Temple of Mitra was excited to see Lillian had been rescued, and detailed a lesser cleric to go with Ioannes to the Silent Factor and transfer the reward money to his account.  Anaximander, the ancient sage they had rescued previously, had been healed of his insanity, and was dictating the events of 250 years ago to some other clerics.  Vael asked for access to Anaximander, and Jador agreed to let him read the notes the clerics had compiled so far, and also personally visit him.  Lillian and Azgallatu said they would stay at the the Temple of Mitra for a few days before heading to Newmarket, while the other freed prisoners got rooms or bunkroom beds elsewhere in Gosterwick.


GM's Comments:

Another large battle, but not as large as last week.  Great Haste is still very good.  Grease is pretty good too.

I need to spend more time with the Foundry Token Attacher module so I can quickly make a train of NPCs follow a PC.

I was not really prepared for the PCs to go down to Goblintown (I should have been, since they were heading for Lillian and Gribble was in the next cell over, but I had wrongly assumed they would just let Gribble go rather than following him home) so had to scramble to find the right paths for everyone to take around the Goblintown map.  Since there wasn't a lot of time left in the session, I rushed through the first meeting with King Weskenim and had him invite them back for another one.


Achievements:

The Rescuers: for rescuing Susarra, Lillian, Gribble, Eadgithu, Geleg, and Grist.
Quest: for bringing Lillian back to the Temple of Mitra
Knockback: 1 XP to Uvash for the first hit with a blunt weapon hard enough to achieve knockback.  (This happened all the time in GURPS 3E, but is rarer in 4E and DFRPG due to some rules changes.)
XP:
Exploration: about 47 rooms (across 3 sessions) (many of them led through goblin territory), 2 XP
Loot: reward money, 2 giant rubies, coins and gems and weapons and armor: 2 XP
Achievements: 2 group achievements, 1 individual achievement for Uvash
Total: 7 XP for Uvash, 6 XP for Vael/Vallium/Ioannes, 4 XP for Michael (missed a session)

Next Week:

The PCs have a lot of options.  The obvious ones are to try to get their reward from King Weskenim, further battle the Cult of Set, or finally deal with Plumthorn's Halflings.  But they also have several parts of the Halls to explore.

DFRPG Bonus Downtime Recap: Strange Happenings in Gosterwick
There's this idea in DFRPG that Town is a "safe zone".  PCs can shop and train there and don't have to worry about being robbed or murdered.

Is that true in Gosterwick, 10 miles south of the ruins of Arden Vul?  Apparently not.

The Right for Riches company returned to Gosterwick after their successful mission to rescue Canon Lillian of the Church of Mitra from the dungeons of the Cult of Set. This mission incidentally resulted in the deaths of about a dozen Settites guarding the path to Lillian's cell, plus about a dozen more Settites in the nearby Temple of Set who just happened to be doing the wrong evil ritutal in the wrong place at the wrong time.  And a giant crocodile who took advantage of the chaos to try to eat an allied NPC.  While the PCs were in the Temple of Set, they also stole anything valuable looking that wasn't too heavy, including a couple of gigantic and incredibly valuable rubies from the largest cult statue's eyes.  And some of the PCs may or may not have urinated on a holy altar of Set; the stories are inconsistent.





(Artistic interpretation of Uvash and Ioannes stealing the ruby eyes of the cult statue in the Temple of Set, over the corpse of the giant crocodile Susarra killed, while Vael, Michael, Vallium, and an unidentified NPC discuss their next move.)
It appears that the Cult of Set was not happy about any of this.  A few days after the Right for Riches Company returned to Gosterwick, two things happened:

Coinbase, leader of the Grudge Brigade Mercenary Company, received an anonymous offer under his door.  It promised a payment of $2500 each for Vael, Vallium, Ioannes, Uvash, Michael, or Susarra, dead or alive.  They or their remains should be brought to the Duty Deacon in the Forum of Set, who would then contact the Pontifex to verify the identify of the invader and pay the reward.  (Coinbase decided to sell the contract to Vael rather than acting on it.)
Susarra was decapitated in her bed at the Yellow Cloak Inn.  Her head and the more valuable and portable parts of her gear were missing.  Vallium, who the innkeeper had seen with Susarra, was called in to identify the body, and then Vael showed up and asked for a blood sample from the victim.  His request was initially denied by the guards at the crime scene, while one of them added Vael's name to A List.  Later that denial was overruled by Audun Yellow-Eyes, head of the Drome in Gosterwick, who sent a blood sample to Vael.
Once he got the blood sample, Vael cast Seeker followed by Trace, revealing that Susarra's head was currently in a backpack tossed in a corner of a comfortable room, about ten miles north of Gosterwick.  Vael could maintain the Trace spell as long as he could stay awake, but could not cast Seeker again for a week, so he advocated cutting short the usual week of downtime between delves and immediately going after whoever murdered Susarra.

To be continued...

After the murder of Susarra, the Right for Riches company decided to head back to Arden Vul before the Trace spell on her head wore off.  Knowing that he couldn't sleep without losing the Trace, Vael first went to the Temple of Mitra to see if any of the priests there could cast Vigil to let him go a night without sleep without ill effects.  Unfortunately, nobody there was able to cast Vigil.

The party then went to the House of Sight in Gosterwick where they were granted a meeting with the logothete, Audun Yellow-Eyes.  Audun explained that he was appalled by the murder of Susarra, but could not officially endorse an attack on Set, or lend any resources to one.  Also that if anyone asked about the vial of Susarra's blood sent to Vael, it wasn't him.

They continued to the Azure Keep to try to arrange a meeting with Lady Alexia.  Unfortunately, she was not available.  They did meet with her steward, Freydis the Stern, who gave her condolences on Susarra and said that she would pass along any inquiries to Lady Alexia when she returned.

With no help forthcoming, they headed out for Arden Vul just after sunset.  A few miles from the Cliff Face, they heard riders coming south down the Imperial Road toward their lights.  It was four Knights of the Azure Shield, who asked them to identify themselves, they had questions about Michael's red scale armor.  They were satisfied with the answer that the armor had come off a dead Settite and there hadn't been time to repaint it before the Settites killed their friend and required a late night attack.  The knights continued their patrol.

When they reached the Cliff Face, they saw lights halfway up the cliff, west of the waterfall, at the site of the Set cult's basket.  Vael Levitated up to try improve his triangulation on Susarra's head.  He was surprised to see that she was at the same elevation as the Set basket, and somewhere west, rather than up at the level of the ruins.  Vael flew back down to confer with the group.  They decided to go up to the ruins of Arden Vul, then back down though the basement, around the halflings, and through the desecrated Temple of Thoth to reach the Temple of Set.

Everyone (except Vael, who was still Levitating) tied themselves together for the night climb.  About halfway up the Long Stair, they encountered a beastman patrol heading down.  The beastmen formed up into a hedgehog formation as their sergeant asked the group to identify themselves.  He then indicated that his group would back up to a wider spot on the trail and allow the party distance to pass, as they were not looking for conflict.  This was agreed, and the Right for Riches company passed by the beastmen as they stood in defensive formation.  They continued to the top of the climb, then north across the ruins.

They group passed through the basement without encountering anything, then went down the spiral stair, west through the illusory wall, south through the destroyed remains of a one-way door.  They discussed going through the catacombs to stay farther from the halflings, but decided the secret door behind the Thoth statue was faster.  They were lucky enough not to meet any halflings, and went down the narrow secret passage west into the desecrated Temple of Thoth.  At that point they heard the blaring of a horn from the secret peephole high on the west wall -- their bright lights had been spotted.

The party quickly went south through a secret door, carefully picked their way through a formerly trapped room, and set off the gas trap again, which had been reset.  Nobody breathed any of the gas, though, and they continued south to the corner, then looked up west to see the barricade had been rebuilt and there were a mass of guards in red Set scale armor behind it, commanded by a sergeant, and accompanied by a goat.

The guards threw Alchemist's Fire flasks at Michael, Vallium, and Ioannes.  Michael was directly hit and set on fire, but he was wearing the Serpent's Amulet and didn't mind.  While the others hung back a bit, Michael started up the stairs.  Meanwhile Vael cast Shape Fire and started moving the rest of the boiling oil up the stairs toward the barricade.  Vallium went up the stairs behind the fire, warning the others not to stand directly behind him.  Uvash trailed Vallium off to one side, and Vael and Ioannes stayed well back.

As Vallium made himself a conspicuous target, he took several shots from crossbows.  He dodged several, trying not to give away that he had an an Amulet of Missile Shield.  Up against the barricade, Michael took a point-blank crossbow shot and failed to dodge it, resulting in a major wound to the chest.  He responded by stabbing the arbalester with his long sword.  The Vael-controlled fire wrecked the Settite line, as half the guards jumped to the sides to avoid the fire, and a couple failed to dodge it, caught on fire, and had to stop, drop, and roll to put it out.

Michael went over the barricade and stabbed a couple more guards.  Vallium followed him over and joined in.  Uvash and Ioannes came up behind, and Ioannes reached over the barricade to heal Michael twice, first with Stop Bleeding and then with Major Healing.  Vael stayed on the stairs and just sent his fire around the room harassing the guards, who occasionally failed to dodge and had to stop fighting for a bit to roll around on the ground.

Meanwhile Sparky the Goat decided to help his sept by charging into battle to slam the invaders with his horns.  Unfortunately for Sparky, Vallium and Michael had shields and heavy armor, so his slams were not enough to knock them over.  Worse, Sparky was not wearing armor, so when he got hit by the fire, the room smelled of burning goat.  After a bit of fire damage and a stray sword or mace shot, Sparky went down and did not get back up.

The Set sergeant recognized that his side was losing, and told one of his unwounded guards to run north to the temple and get reinforcements.  Vael responded by sending some of his fire after that guard to try to slow him down.  Eventually, the Settites lost 6 elite guards and a goat, while 2 guards and the sergeant managed to flee north.

As Uvash ate some singed goat, Vael checked his Trace and found that Susarra's head was down and west.  The Right for Riches company quickly regrouped to discuss their next move.  Did they chase north through the temple, or cut west and try to reach the stairs?  Taking a quick look through the burned curtains, they saw some cultists  fleeing west and a giant lizard chasing a boar.  Deciding to avoid that chaos, they went back into the room to the south and grabbed a couple of flasks of Alchemist's Fire and a couple of maces that Vael thought looked nice, plus a few silver coins from a chest.  After leaving some rude graffiti and setting a few cots on fire, they went west through the passages between the temple and the prison, trying to outflank the guards in the temple and reach the stairs down.

Unfortunately for them, the Settites had thought of this, and there was a large group of guards waiting on the wide stairs.  It was a dozen guards, four acolytes, and a couple of sergeants, including the one they had just been fighting.  About half the guards had crossbows ready, and one of the sergeants was yelling "nobody use fire."


Start of the battle on the wide stairs




Vallium, with his Amulet of Missile Shield, led the way, trying to draw more crossbow fire.  Michael followed behind, drawing his boomerang.  He threw it into the clump of guards, missing one near the front.  Unfortunately for the guards, it was a target-rich environment, and the boomerang missed or was dodged by two more guards, before it plunked one in the back who had no idea was was happening.  He fell down, momentarily stunned, and dropped his mace.

Four of the six guards with crossbows fired at Vallium.  He dodged all of the shots (some legitimately, some with magical help), before critically failing one Dodge roll and starting to fall down.  Realizing that he didn't want to be prone next to a pile of enemies, he used Luck to reroll the critical failure and avoid the fall.  The last two crossbowmen held their fire, as the sergeant said something about waiting for a better target.  The guards in the back with maces and shields ready started surging to the front.

Uvash prayed for his Heroic Grace and got a great result, +7 to DX for 13 turns.  He decided to use this temporary blessing to go for aimed shots at the skull and try to knock guards unconscious with one blow.  Meanwhile Michael and Vallium just went toe-to-toe with the front row of guards and started cutting them down, Vallium with single Deceptive Attacks, Michael with double Rapid Strikes.

Vael considered coming around the corner to help, but realized he'd probably get shot as soon as he did, so paused to cast Missile Shield on himself.  As soon as he emerged, the last two crossbowmen used their Wait maneuvers to drill him, and missed due to the spell.  After laughing at them, Vael cast Grease into the swarm of guards.  Meanwhile, two of the acolytes in the back were casting spells of their own: Dispel Magic, trying to take out whatever buffs the PCs had.  Both succeeded by slim margins, and failed to knock the Bless off any of the four PCs in the area of effect, as Ioannes outrolled them.  They also failed to dispel Vael's Trace.

Michael and Vallium continued cutting into the swarm, aided by the defense penalty for Grease.  Uvash meanwhile started smashing skulls, failing to one-shot kill any unwounded guards, but knocking a few unconscious.  Vael, seeing the acolytes in the back casting more spells, followed up his Grease with a Smoke, trying to mess up everyone's concentration.


Battle after Grease (right circle) and Smoke (left circle) were cast


At some point the remaining Settites started fleeing west down the stairs.  All the sergeants and acolytes and a couple of the guards got away, while Michael and Vallium and Uvash cut down the stragglers.

Vael checked his Trace and saw that Susarra's head was still down and west.  The Right for Riches Company started down the wide stairs after the Settites.  There were realistic busts of (mostly) older men flanking both sides of the stairs, probably Settite priests.  Uvash wanted to spend some time smashing them, but the others pressed him to hurry up and pursue.  As they continued down, the stairs bent left, from west to southwest and then south.  And the busts were replaced by some stuffed heads of various creatures: reptilian humanoids, one with horns, a bat, even a frost giant.  The frost giant head was enchanted, and started swearing in several languages (some the PCs knew, and some they didn't) as they approached.  Uvash put some leftover goat meat into its mouth to attempt to shut it up, but it didn't work.

As the stairs debouched into a wide Forum, the party saw a passage running east to a portcullis, with a couple of guys in leather armor behind it.  At the bottom of the stairs were a mass of guards, including the ones that just fled plus some more.  Beyond the guards was a huge statue of Set in Set animal form, with several slaves chained to it.  It appeared they may have finally reached the Forum of Set.

We paused there due to time.

GM's Comments:

As expected, the Settites reinforced the guard post in front of their temple.  Not well enough though.  The PCs decided to continue down the stairs rather than retreating to Gosterwick after the second battle, figuring they didn't have enough exploration or loot to earn any XP, and that they should do some more damage or make some more progress.

Crossbows don't combine well with maces and shields.  Crossbows do great damage if they hit, but they take two hands, and it takes forever to ready a shield.  Without a shield, an unbalanced mace is a much worse weapon, as it can't both attack and parry in the same turn.  The cult of Set might consider swapping some maces for spears, or some shields for bucklers.

Sparky tasted better than he fought.


Achievements:

The PCs caught just a glimpse of the Forum of Set at the end of the session.  They haven't actually entered it or seen most of it yet though.

XP:

None until they go back to town.  So far they have only visited a couple of new locations, grabbed a small amount of loot, and glimpsed the edge of the Forum of Set.

Next Week:

The Right for Riches Company appears to be invading the Forum of Set.  Do they smash a major faction of Arden Vul, or get swarmed and make new PCs?  I have no idea.

We resumed the battle with the Right for Riches company having chased the retreating Settites down the Sighing Stair into the Forum of Set.  At that point the party paused, because there was a portcullis on their left side and they were worried about being surrounded if they continued.  The Settites also paused at the bottom of the stairs, to form up and load crossbows.


Start of the battle


After aiming for a bit, the Settites loosed a volley of crossbow bolts.  Vallium was missed due to his Amulet of Missile Shield.  Vael was behind a wall to the west and out of line of sight, so didn't receive any shots.  Ioannes, Michael, and Uvash each dodged, blocked, or were missed by a couple of bolts.  The Settites dropped their crossbows and readied their melee weapons as they surged forward.

Meanwhile the Settites behind the portcullis to the east rang an alarm gong to summon more guards.  Not wanting to deal with assault from that direction, Vael cast Smoke on those guards, distracting them and wrecking their line of sight.  The one with the gong kept ringing it though.

Uvash used his Divine Grace, which gave him +7 to DX for 13 turns.  With only a short period with Super Dwarf available, the PCs surged forward to meet the mass of Settites at the bottom of the stairs.  Michael readied an Alchemist Fire potion and threw it at one of the Settites.  He missed, but there were so many that it landed in another Settite's hex behind the target, doing some splash damage.

The Right of Riches Company had their shields, while most of the Settite guards had dropped theirs to fire crossbows and had not had a chance to pick them back up, so the PCs were at an advantage.  They cut down a few guards, killing a couple and knocking a couple of others unconcious, but a bunch more approached from the south and southeast.  When things started getting a bit lopsided, Vael threw a Smoke south of the stairs to slow the reinforcements, but the Settites started coming up the stairs and flanked Michael.


The Smoke slows further reinforcements, but there are enough to surround Michael, as the other PCs start falling back.

While surrounded by several Settites, Michael fell down, and appeared doomed.  He managed to regain his feet, but was reeling from his wounds, so his Move and Dodge were reduced.  He was a bit far for Uvash or Ioannes to heal him.  As he tried running up the stairs toward his comrades, one of the Settite guards appeared to hit him cleanly in the back for serious damage -- but Michael's Bless spell averted the attack.  Vael dropped a Grease on the stairs, while caused many of the Settites to fall and others to move more slowly, while Michael's Ring of Free Action let him keep going.  Eventually Michael got close enough to Uvash and Ioannes that they were able to drop a Stop Bleeding and a Major Healing on him, healing him enough to get his full Move back.  At that point Michael was as fast as the Settites, and the other PCs were faster, so they were able to escape up the stairs, with a swarm of Settites in tow.

The Right for Riches Company made it to the top of the Sighing Stair, ran east through the Temple of Set, then south and east past the barricade, then north into the desecrated Temple of Thoth, then down the skinny secret passage to the east.  The faster PCs ran at full speed to buy themselves a few seconds.  Ioannes and Uvash both cast Lend Energy on Vael, who was ready to cast Magelock on the door as soon as Michael came through it.

Unfortunately, right as the lead PCs came out the secret door, Roskelly and several of his halfling toll collector thugs were standing right in that area, looking at the statue.  They immediately started talking about tolls and dungeoneering licenses and asking where the PCs came from, since they hadn't come down the stairs from the Pyramid of Thoth.  Vael pulled out his Dungeoneering License pin and flashed it at Roskelly and said they were a little busy with pursuing Settites right now.  That caused the halflings to take a few steps back toward their territory.  Michael came running through the door, Vallium slammed it closed, and Vael cast Magelock on it.  As they heard the Settites start trying to break the door down, the PCs discussed whether to go north toward the stairs up to the basement, or south to the pyramid teleporter to the Well of Light.  They went toward the basement, and the halflings let them go.

Having not found significant loot or explored much new territory, the Right for Riches company decided to keep delving rather than heading back to towh.  Rather than going upstairs to the basement, they headed east to the bridge over the chasm, and back into the room with the baboon-headed Thoth statue.  Vallium dug through his notes looking for the statue arm settings that opened a door last time, while Vael tried Lockmaster on a locked door to the north.  The spell unexpectedly failed, but a second attempt was a critical success and unlocked the door.  After listening at the door, Vallium went north into a room with 3 sarcophagi.  He motioned the others to stay back, indicating that if there were any arrow traps he didn't want anyone getting hit.  He then pulled the lid off the nearest sarcophagus.  He got a glimpse at a (non-moving) mummy, as tons of sand started pouring out of the ceiling.  Vael and Ioannes, who had been just inside the room, hopped out.  Vallium ran for the exit, which took him about three seconds, through rapidly rising sand, but he made it without falling.  As they looked into the room from the corridor outside they saw that it was buried under many tons of sand.  Vael said they could come back another time with digging tools and digging spells, but for now they should try another way.

They went back into the room with the statue and manipulated its arms to a few different positions.  Two positions each caused a secret door to open and an ibis-headed Guardian of Thoth to emerge to attack them, but the fights were five on one and the Guardians were not that hard to defeat.  A third position caused a door leading east to unlock, and the group went down a passage.

They went past a room to the north with previously looted sarcophagi, then past a large room where Vael had previously defeated a statue by Levitating out of reach, then past a Continually Lit room with a fountain that had given Uvash donkey ears, before finding a new room to the north.  The room had frescoes on all the walls featuring the exploits of the Archontean folk hero Larel One-Eye, who both Vallium and Ioannes recognized.  There were also a cloak rack with several cloaks; a chest; a weapons rack with a variety of knives; a desk with a golden apple, a silver letter opener, and some letters; and a pedestal with a funerary urn on it.  Vael and Ioannes went around the room looking for magic, and found that several of the knives and a couple of the cloaks looked magical, as did the apple.  Vallium checked to see if any of the items looked like the ones on the walls, and a multi-colored cloak looked like Larel's cloak, while one of the knives looked like Larel's stiletto.  Ioannes thought the multi-colored cloak might be magical, while Vael was pretty sure it wasn't, but Vallium put it on and turned invisible.  That settled the debate.  Vael declared that something in the room was interfering with magic detection, and they should take everything.  The letters on the desk all claimed to be from Larel to three different women, and all used the exact same phrasing with only the name changed.  Vael Apportated the chest open and found some clothing; inside a stocking cap Ioannes found a sack.  He reached into the sack and pulled out a rock, and decided the sack was special.  The urn did not appear magical, and the party left that behind.  They searched under the desk and along all the walls, then continued east.

There were doors north and east.  Behind the north door were spiral stairs up.  Vallium decided to go up.  This led them to an area they'd found before, northeast of the Well of Light.  There they remembered a secret door that they had found (with magical assistance after performing the Litany of Light) but never opened.  Vael figured out how to open it, and they opened it to reveal stairs up, with Thothian frescoes.

At the top of the stairs was a a large and interesting room.  There were two rows of statues of Archontean heroes of the past, with a few of the statues missing.  There were also several old corpses in the room.  Iaonnes inspected the bodies and thought they had been violently killed by something strong.  The bodies contained some weapons and armor, a few coins, a couple of potions, and a scroll.  Vael looked everything over and detected a magic sling and a magic shield.  The group then started looking around the edges of the room.  There were eight shrines, but seven of them were closed off behind some kind of magical force fields.  The one that was open contained a book and a quill and some Mithric writing.  Everyone decided to leave the shrine alone for now and come back later.  There was also a large statue of Thoth in ibis-headed form, with some orange gas descending from its beak, and some Mithric writing about pneuma.  Vael said that he had some theories about the statue and the shrine but they should leave for now and come back later.

They went back down to the Well of Light level, then went west and south to the actual Well of Light without encountering any baboons, and Vael cast Flight on Vallium and Michael and Levitation on himself, and everyone flew up the Well, with Vallium and Michael carrying Ioannes and Uvash.  They walked south across the ruins of Arden Vul, climbed down the Cliff Face (with Ioannes using his Luck to avoid a careless fall) and hiked back to Gosterwick.  They met another patrol of Knights of the Azure Shield on the Imperial Road before reaching town, but the Knights just asked them for news of the Settites and let them pass.

For security, Vallium, Uvash, and Michael moved out of the Yellow Cloak Inn and moved into the Arcane Practitioners Club with Vael and Ioannes.  They resolved to treat Gosterwick as a dangerous place after Susarra's murder and try to watch each other's backs.  Vael started analyzing all the items they recovered, casting Analyze Magic multiple times per item in case the magic concealing effect interfered with it.  It appeared that Larel's Cloak, Larel's Sack, and Larel's Pin (the letter opener) were quite powerful items.

GM's Comments:

Superior numbers are good.  The Right for Riches Company appear to be better than Settites, but not better than dozens and dozens of Settites.

I was pretty sure Michael was toast when he was significantly separated from the rest of the party with a whole lot of Settites in between, but Bless and heavy armor and some lucky die rolls and Grease and the Ring of Free Action, plus some timely healing spells, saved him.

I thought it would be hilarious if the PCs took all of Larel's decoy items and missed the concealed good ones, but Ioannes rolled a critical success on a Per+Magery roll, and Vallium thought to correlate the items in the frescoes with the items in the room, and Vael then declared they should take everything in the room even if they didn't think it was magical (except the urn), so that didn't happen.

I think the players were more excited to find a new stairway up than they were to find unguarded magic items.

They have a lot of options.  They can go after the Set Cult again, or deal with the halflings, or try to revisit the goblins, or explore more of the Halls of Thoth east of the chasm, or go back to the Hall of Shrines.  Or a half-dozen other places.  Arden Vul is big.
