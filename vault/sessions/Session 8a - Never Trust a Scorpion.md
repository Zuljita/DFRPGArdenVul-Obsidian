Last delve, the party found a very heavy and regal-looking magical rod on the richly dressed female corpse in the solarium of the Archon's Palace of Arden Vul.  They brought it to Vael to analyze, but he gave up after finding a couple of enchantments.  They then took it to Lyssandra and Pelteon at the Arcane Practitioners' Club, who identified a bunch more enchantments but said it only had a few charges left, and said Lady Alexia might want it.  The group decided to sell the rod to Lady Alexia, and also sold her the noblewoman's magic shortsword since none of them used a shortsword.

Lady Alexia's steward Freydis asked for a meeting to discuss where the items were found and any other details the finders could share.  Vallium showed up for the meeting and explained that they'd found the rod and shortsword on a desiccated corpse of a nobly dressed woman in the solarium, and that the body had also had a signet ring.  Freydis looked at the signet ring and then asked Vallium to return later, after she had a chance to converse with Lady Alexia.  When Vallium came back, Lady Alexia herself was waiting along with Freydis.  The Green Lady said that the signet ring was definitely from her family, Basileon, and that she would like to buy it if possible.  She also said she thought the body they had found was probably her ancestor Uriel Basileon, the last Archon of the city of Arden Vul before it was destroyed, and that she would appreciate the group showing some of her knights where the body was, so they could give it a proper burial.  Vallium agreed.

The night before before leaving, Uvash cast Bless on Ioannes from the scroll they had found, and then Ioannes cast Bless on the other four PCs using the spell.  Vael made a pile of Continual Light rocks.

Early the next morning, when the party arrived at the Water Gate, there were three Knights of the Azure Shield waiting for them, along with three squires, and a teamster driving a horse-drawn wagon.  The leader of the knights introduced herself as Sir Lucia, a Knight Commander, and said they were tasked with recovering the body of the Archon.  The knights had horses and the PCs did not, so the knights offered to let them ride in the wagon.  (It wasn't much faster than walking, but it was easier.)

Eventually the large group reached the base of the cliff face leading up to Arden Vul.  Sir Lucia detailed a knight and a squire to stay with the horses and wagon, while two knights and two squires roped themselves together before starting the climb up the Long Stair.  Noticing the PCs weren't roped together, Sir Lucia asked if they wanted to borrow any rope.  They did, and roped themselves together, except for Vael who chose to Levitate instead of walking.

The group made it about two-thirds of the way up the Cliff Face without mishap, but then Michael slipped on the rainy trail, and Uvash was unable to quickly steady him.  He looked like he was hurtling over the edge, possibly dragging Uvash behind him, when he suddenly tripped and got stuck behind a root near the edge.  His Bless spell was gone, but had saved him from a possibly fatal fall.  The group continued to the top, and then Ioannes asked the knights for a rest break and cast another Bless on Michael.  The knights stood at near-attention showing off that they didn't need to rest despite the long climb in armor, while Ioannes recovered from casting the major spell.

Fully rested, the PCs led the knights north to the Forum, then west across a bridge to the island, then north to the ruins of the Archon's Palace.  Vallium then chose the same gap in the wall as last time, and led the group back into the solarium.  Archon Basileon's body was where they had left it.  One of the squires pulled a canvas burial sack out of his pack, the Knight Commander said a few words, then two squires packed the corpse into the bag and carried it out.  Vael asked the knights if they needed an escort back to the top of the Long Stair, but Sir Lucia said the path was pretty simple and two knights and two squires should be able to handle themselves, and said their farewells before heading back south.

The group had a discussion of where to explore next.  Going back under the Pyramid of Thoth to deal with the halflings was the most popular idea, but Vael suggested scouting with an invisible Wizard Eye rather than just attacking, as they still weren't sure how many halflings there were.  Everyone agreed, and then they walked to the top of the pyramid, manipulated the statue's arms to uncover the stairs down toward the Glory of Thoth, and went down the stairs to the second landing, about 350' above the halflings.  There Vael stopped to cast Wizard Eye, then cast Invisibility on his Wizard Eye, then send the Wizard Eye downstairs to spy.  He indicated that all this spellcasting would be very strenuous, and would appreciate if Uvash and Ioannes could lend him some energy while he did that.  All the casting went well, and the Wizard Eye went flew down the stairs into darkness.  Vael quickly discovered that navigating a pitch black stairway wasn't easy, even for a flying eye, but managed to avoid slamming the Eye into any walls at high speed, until it could see torchlight ahead.

While Vael was steering the Wizard Eye, a group of four giant rats smelled food and came charging into the room.  Vallium and Michael and Uvash and Ioannes fought the rats, while Vael sat in the corner and focused on not losing his Wizard Eye.  They managed to defeat the rats without anyone sustaining injury, with three rats killed and the last one scurrying away back down the stairs.

Meanwhile, the Wizard Eye emerged into the Glory of Thoth, where Roskelly and five other halflings were standing guard in the shadows near the central statue, watching the various entrances to the room more vigilantly than in the past.  The Eye flew east, through a gap in the portcullis and past two more halflings guarding it.  The corridor went dark again, but there were lit rooms in three directions: east, north, and south.

The eye went east first, and found a room containing a halfling sitting on a bedroll reading and writing letters, two more halflings guarding an entrance to the Great Chasm in the northeast of the room, and a human man taking some notes.  Vael's Eye spied on the human first; his writing seemed to involve some alchemical processes, which Vael didn't understand in detail.  He then spied on the halfling, and saw that this was Plumthorn, reading a letter about how a certain merchant in Newmarket was severely late with his protection money, and writing a short note back instructing that it was time to break some knees.

The Eye went back to the dark crossroads, and then flew north.  The next lit room contained about nine halflings.  Once again there was access to the Great Chasm, and two halflings were guarding it.  Most of the others were sitting around a campfire, talking.  One was writing a letter, which appeared to be of a romantic nature.

Finally, Vael flew the Eye south.  Its view of the torch-lit room to the south was interrupted by some kind of barricade, but it didn't fill the whole passage, so the Eye was able to easily fly up over it.  The room to the south contained many bedrolls, some of them with sleeping halflings inside.  There was a barricade in the southeast corner of the room, guarded by two halflings, and leading to a dark tunnel sloping down.  The Eye couldn't see far enough into the dark tunnel to know what was down there.

Having explored everything he could see, Vael stopped maintaining the Wizard Eye.  After a bit of rest, the group discussed going downstairs and attacking the halflings, but the combination of the vigilance of Roskelly's vanguard, and the number of reinforcements available in the other rooms, made them decide to prepare more and return another day.  They went back up the stairs, out of the Pyramid, and then south to the Forum.  Vael wanted to cast Analyze Magic on the magical bronze doors to the square tower there.

He managed to cast the long spell without interruption, and found that the doors were Magelocked.  There were additional enchantments, but he figured Magelock was enough to keep them out so it wasn't worth spending more time at the doors.  With the doors probably impassible, their other choice for the square tower was to fly everyone up to the roof then descend down the stairs into magical darkness.  That seemed dangerous, so someone suggested going back to the Great Pyramid, down the other staircase, and using the bust of Selket with a scorpion on her head there to teleport to the Great Hall, near the (mostly friendly, or at least more friendly than the halflings) Children of Deino.

They manipulated the arms of the statue of Thoth to point straight up to reveal the less-used entrance, then walked down the stairs.  They expected a pit trap at the end of the hallway, but did not expect the stairs to turn into a ramp and attempt to help them into the pit, as that had failed to trigger last time.  This time, it again failed to trigger for Vallium in the lead, but worked correctly when Michael in the second position stepped onto the trapped stair.  Fortunately for them, both Vallium and Michael reacted quickly when the stairs collapsed under their feet.  Michael jumped back onto the safe stairs, and Vallium, too far down the ramp to reach the stairs, managed to wedge himself between the two walls of the narrow tunnel and hold on until help arrived.  The help was Vael casting a Flight spell on Vallium.  Vallium flew back to the rest of the group, tested to see if he was strong enough to pick up Michael, then carried Michael down the ramp and into the bottom of the pit of bones.  There were no demons there, so Vallium left Michael there and flew back to grab the others, and carried each of them in turn before the Flight spell expired.

Fully assembled, the group continued east into the room with the scary black portal and the bust of Selket with the teleport trap.  This time, instead of one small spherical demon with a lot of teeth, there were three.  Nobody achieved surprise, and the demons charged Vallium and Michael and Uvash in the front.  They killed one of the demons, another escaped through the black portal, and the third disappeared into the portal just as Michael ran his sword through it, so they were not quite sure if they killed it.

Vael suggested searching the room again, but sadly they found no additional treasure.  He then decided to send a Wizard Eye into the black portal to check it out, but lost contact with the Wizard Eye immediately when it went through.  He wasn't sure exactly what that meant, except that they definitely didn't want to go into that portal.  Instead, they formed up by the bust of Selket, and all pulled the scorpion's tail at the same time, expecting to teleport to the Great Hall.

They teleported, but somewhere else!  They were in an underground cavern, larger in every direction than their Continual Light illuminated, with an underground stream rushing by near their feet.  Looking around, they spotted a tent, and a magical circle of paving stones next to an array of 8"x8" stone square frames, just like the one they saw in the ruins of the Archon's Palace.  They were looking for a good spot to cross the water to check out the tent, when a loud voice erupted in broken Archontean.  Who were they and what were they doing in his cave?

There was an 8' tall green creature, like a double-sized goblin, wearing a shiny silver cloak, standing in front of them.  At least it wasn't attacking them.  A long conversation occurred.  His name was Gog, he was a varumani, and this was his cave.  They explained that they had hit a teleporter and he laughed and asked if they had any food.  Ioannes offered some rations and Gog spit and explained that he wanted good surface food, not yucky rations.  Someone made a snide comment about being surprised that this thing spoke Archontean and Gog replied that he probably spoke more languages than they did and they should be more polite.  A quick test revealed that Gog understood at least a few words of both Elvish and Dwarvish.

Ioannes asked if Gog was friends with the halflings and he said that, no, he was friends with the goblins and the halflings were not so he didn't much like the halflings.  But, no, he didn't eat halflings, eating other sentients was uncivilized.  Asked for information, Gog indicated that they should bring food in trade, but quickly pointed around and said that the goblins were to the southeast and they were his friends and nobody should hurt them, and that the Hall of Forty Pillars and the Obsidian Gates were up a hill to the north and that going that way would probably be fatal and not to yell to Gog for help if they insisted on doing it.  Asked if he knew how to get back up to the surface, Gog led them northeast, opened a secret door, and showed them a staircase leading up.  He said it led to a secret door south of the halflings.

The conversation was rudely interrupted by two humans and a halfling falling from the ceiling and hitting the ground a bit to the west.  Gog, not appearing very surprised, walked over to check on them.  The halfling had a broken leg.  Both humans had the wind knocked out of them, but were mostly okay.  One of the humans, a very good-looking warrior, introduced himself as Dalton.  He said that his adventuring party had been just west of the Glory of Thoth, messing with the arms of a statue, when a pit opened up under three of them and sent them down a chute.  His companions were named Helga and Isidor.  Isidor asked if anyone had a healing potion, and Dalton gave him one.  There was a brief discussion about Plumthorn's halfling thugs, who Dalton admitted paying off to be allowed to pass through their territory.  Isidor made it clear that he was a adventurer, not one of Plumthorn's gang.  Dalton asked if anyone knew the way back up, and Gog let the PCs show him the secret door.  Dalton said that they needed to get back to the rest of the group before anyone got too worried, but they should meet again sometime at the Inn of the Broken Head and have a longer conversation.  Ioannes asked if that was in Gosterwick, and Dalton laughed and said it was in the northwest of the ruins, and he had no idea how anyone could get this deep in the Halls of Arden Vul without even finding the Broken Head.  Vael was suspicious.

With the other adventuring party gone, the PCs asked Gog if he was okay with them exploring.  Gog pointed to his tent and an island in the stream and said "leave Gog's stuff alone", and then pointed to the southeast and said "don't hurt the goblins", and then pointed at the water and said "do not destroy environment only take a few fish not all the fish" but indicated that otherwise they could go where they wanted.  They decided to go northeast, where there was a steep slope down about 25 feet, with some old human and goblin corpses at the bottom.  Vallium threw a Continual Light rock down the hill to light the way ahead before they went down.

The slope was steep enough that Vael cast Flight on Vallium again and let him help people down.  Iaonnes checked the corpses for signs of death and saw that one of the goblins had died violently, but beyond that wasn't very sure.  Vael spotted magic and found that one corpse had a small magical silver statue of an eye.  He had no idea what it was, but pocketed it.  The bodies also had a stone axe, a few crystals and pearls that might be worth something, and a scroll of Thothian religious sayings that Uvash thought was worth taking.

The cavern continued northeast.  There were a lot of bats flying around, and there was a shelf to the north, up beyond the edge of their light.  Vael decided to send a Wizard Eye up there to explore, but the last thing the Wizard Eye saw was the mouth of a giant bat chomping it out of existence.  Vael cast Seek Earth for gold to get an indication of which way to go, and detected gold close by to the south.  Much searching for secret doors commenced, and nobody found one.  Vael pulled out the ring of looking through walls and saw a tunnel with piles of gold at the end.  He cast Seek Earth again and decided the gold was up a bit, so used Levitate to search higher.  Eventually the group went back west and found the secret door about fifteen feet up on a wall they had previously passed.  Vael could not figure out how to open it though.  He took turns casting Levitate on everyone, flying them all up, and having them all fail to figure out the trick.  Finally, they resorted to brute force, grabbing the stone axe off the corpse, and bashing the secret door until it caved in.  Somehow this failed to attract any wandering monsters.

The secret door led to a short tunnel with a door at the far end, with no gold visible.  Vael started to suspect the ring was cursed, as the information it provided was not always useful.  Vallium dropped a rope from the tunnel down to the cave floor, and everyone successfully climbed it.  The group listened at the door, heard nothing, and opened it.  On the other side was a Thothian tomb, with a body levitating in the air, wearing a gold helmet and an iron ankh, four Thothian statues lining the walls, and some golden furniture on the other side of the room.  A booming voice said, in Mithric, "You have found me; let me lie."

Ioannes said that he would be happy to let the body lie but there might be treasure.  Vael was pretty sure the statues were stone guardians that would try to kill them, and tried detecting magic.  One of the statues was magic, so he slowly cast Analyze Magic to determine its nature.  Meanwhile Ioannes checked out the gold furniture.  He picked up a gold chair, which turned out to be suspiciously light.  When he sat on it, it collapsed under his weight, revealing that it was just an old wooden chair painted yellow.  The Analyze Magic showed the only magic on the statue was just the sound illusion causing it to yell warnings.

Deciding that maybe the statues wouldn't kill them after all, Vael used Apportation to try to grab the golden helmet from the corpse.  This triggered a trap, with green gas starting to spew from all four statues.  Four out of five PCs immediately ran for the exit.  Vael instead started casting Purify Air spells.  He critically failed the first one, but instantly used his Luck to get a reroll before learning the consequences of failure.  Purify Air was an area spell, and casting one big enough to clear the whole room would be expensive, but his idea was to keep running around the room casting cheap one-hex Purify Air spells until all the gas was gone, like using a large number of tiny car air fresheners to clean a toxic waste dump.  Luckily for him, the trap had a finite amount of gas, and he didn't fail any more spell rolls after his Luck was used up, so he eventually cleared the room of the green gas.  He let the others know that the room was safe, and they all returned.  The golden helmet that had set off the trap turned out to be a fairly cheap-looking bronze helmet with a bit of gold plating.

Vael cast another Seek Earth for gold, excluding the helmet, and detected more gold nearby to the south.  Everyone searched for secret doors, and Vallium found that one of the statues could be moved and there was a door behind it.  Behind the door was a very cobwebby and dusty passage heading east.  Nobody say any huge spiders, so they all went down the passage, into another Thothian room.  There was an inscription on the wall in Mithric: "Knowledge of Thoth and His Mysteries Reveals the Way."

This room had four more statues, of Thoth in his scribe position, arms on knees.  Each had an 8" square hole, and each had a different object on its knees and a different inscription.  One statue had a torch and said "Thoth consumes light."  One had a figurine of a human and said "Thoth consumes the Ka."  One had a scroll and said "Thoth consumes sorcerous wisdom."  The last had a wand and read "Thoth consumes magic."  There was a door on the south wall, but it would not open, even to a lot of force.

Much discussion ensued.  Ioannes tried a Theology roll but didn't get much.  Vael tried a Hidden Lore: Magical Writings roll that told him the light and Ka ones were probably wrong and the wisdom and magic ones were probably right.  Touching the statues did nothing.  Dropping the scroll of Thothian prayers that they had just found into a hole didn't work, and they didn't get the scroll back.  Dropping a Continual Light rock into the hole of the statue with the wand caused a click from the door to the south.  It was unlocked!

They continued south into another small tomb, this one with a lot of Thothian bas-reliefs on the walls, and three sarcophagi, two of them fancier and one plainer.  The west wall had a mural of seven Thothian priests with the biggest labeled "Muirasso."  After a brief discussion, Vallium lifted the lid of the western sarcophagus, and undead started coming out of the walls...

We ran out of time there, and paused just before starting the combat.


GM's Comments:

The PCs helped Lady Alexia recover her ancestor's body, scouted out Plumthorn's gang with Wizard Eye, fought some more rats and small round demons, found that traps and teleporters don't always work as consistently as you'd like, found a new level, met Gog, met Dalton and a couple of his friends, and explored a hidden tomb until they opened the wrong sarcophagus and undead came out of the walls.  A pretty normal week.  Very light on treasure so far, but they're not done yet.


Achievements:

None


XP:

Incomplete, as they haven't made it back to town.  They've done significant exploration and found a little bit of loot, but they don't get credit for it until they make it out.  If they make it back next session, they'll get credit for all the exploration and loot across both sessions.


Next Week: 

For once, I can confidently say what they'll be doing at the start of the next session: fighting undead.  After that, I'm less sure, but I suspect that if they win, they'll try to finish looting the tomb, then try to find a way home.  And if they lose, they'll get to make new PCs.
