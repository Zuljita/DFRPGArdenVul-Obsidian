The session began where the previous one paused, with Vallium pulling the lid off a sarcophagus in [[npcs/Muirasso.md|Muirasso]]'s tomb.  The wight of [[npcs/Muirasso.md|Muirasso]] jumped out of the sarcophagus, holding a glowing broadsword, and attacked Vallium for disturbing his unrest.  Meanwhile, a couple of zombies emerged from the bas reliefs in the walls and charged other members of the party.  A long melee ensued, with additional zombies continually emerging from the walls.  Vael cast Grease on the floor, which caused the wight and several zombies to slip and fall.  Vallium stabbed the wight several times, while Michael and Uvash attacked zombies.  Ioannes cast Flaming Weapon and Shield, and Vael followed up with Blur.  Uvash started aiming at feet to knock down zombies that were still standing.  Eventually the wight was inactive and all the zombies were down, and whatever magic or curse had bound the zombies started failing and they lost their will to fight.

Ioannes cast Stop Bleeding on Michael to fix a minor wound, while the rest of the group looted the room.  They took the wight's glowing broadsword and a bunch of ancient silver and copper coins from his sarcophagus, plus a magic jug and a couple of flasks containing bright blue liquid.  Vallium knocked the lid off a second sarcophagus, and some green gas started pouring out.  Most of the group fled the room, while Vael cast Purify Air, which revealed that the gas was coming out of a canopic jar inside the sarcophagus.  Uvash ran into to put the crocodile-head lid back on the jar, which stopped the release of gas.  The third sarcophagus contained another gas-spewing canopic jar, which they handled the same way.

With all visible treasure taken, they searched for secret doors.  They found one in the southwest corner of the room, but could not open it.  Ioannes thought he found another one in the southeast corner, but everyone else thought it was just a line between bricks.  Stuck, Vael cast Seek Earth for gold, and though there was gold about six yards to the south.  They decided to go back to [[locations/Gosterwick.md|Gosterwick]], then south to the dam.  Their padlock was still there, and when they unlocked it they found their wheelbarrow and tools still inside.  They discussed whether to leave the treasure in the dam house while they explored the ruins, or put it in the wheelbarrow and take it with them.  Ultimately they decided that having it stolen from the dam would be the worst outcome, so they put the treasure in a chest and put the chest in the wheelbarrow.

Vallium suggested exploring the northern island in the [[locations/Swift River.md|Swift River]].  Michael pushed the wheelbarrrow as the group headed for the bridge to that island.  But when they got close to the bridge, they heard yelling from a tower to their north to stop, and someone shot a crossbow bolt over their head into the bridge.  They approached the tower, where a couple of armed men told them that there were deadly stone constructs on that island who would kill anyone who crossed the bridge, but fortunately the constructs did not leave the island.  Some discussion revealed that the leader's name was [[npcs/Eggbert.md|Eggbert]], and that he worked for a man named Kronos who ran the [[locations/Inn of the Broken Head.md|Inn of the Broken Head]], a bit to the northwest.

The group decided to visit the Inn, and followed [[npcs/Eggbert.md|Eggbert]]'s directions to go west to the river.  Soon enough, they saw the Inn.  The Inn was a fortified two-story building, and there were several smaller outbuildings surrounding it.  There was the head of a large statue of [[npcs/Arden.md|Arden]] hanging above the front door, and both Vael and Ioannes thought the head looked magical.  Ioannes, Michael, and [[npcs/Merenuithiel Lacrymosa [[npcs/Merenuithiel Lacrymosa Armaris.md|Merenuithiel Lacrymosa Armaris]].md|Merenuithiel Lacrymosa [[npcs/Merenuithiel Lacrymosa Armaris.md|Merenuithiel Lacrymosa Armaris]]]] stayed with the wheelbarrow, while Vael and Vallium went inside.

Inside the Inn was brightly lit by a couple of Continual Light rocks.  Kronos, a large Thorcin man, was behind the bar, with an Archontean woman named [[npcs/Estelle.md|Estelle]] by his side.  They greeted the party and asked if they wanted beer or ale.  Vael bought a round for the group and carried some outside to the treasure guards, then started asking Kronos questions.  It turned out the Inn had three merchant factors in residence, all competing to buy statues looted from the ruins.  Vael mentioned they had some statues to sell, and within a couple minutes all three factors came rushing down the stairs: [[npcs/Crisarius Three-Legs.md|Crisarius Three-Legs]] from the [[factions/Prosperity Factor.md|Prosperity Factor]], [[npcs/Fenitior Stone-Hands.md|Fenitior Stone-Hands]], from the [[factions/Wisdom Factor.md|Wisdom Factor]], and Godric the Wise from the [[factions/Golden Band.md|Golden Band]].  Vael interrogated all three about their businesses and services available, and then went to get a couple of the gold shabti statues and said they were available to the highest bidder.  [[npcs/Merenuithiel Lacrymosa [[npcs/Merenuithiel Lacrymosa Armaris.md|Merenuithiel Lacrymosa Armaris]].md|Merenuithiel Lacrymosa [[npcs/Merenuithiel Lacrymosa Armaris.md|Merenuithiel Lacrymosa Armaris]]]] came inside to help negotiate, and eventually Godric bought all three shabti statues in exchange for some valuable (and much lighter) gems.

Vael went outside and spent the time to cast Analyze Magic on the head of [[npcs/Arden.md|Arden]], which revealed that it could speak if addressed respectfully.  He talked to the head and it told him "Restore me!  Courage shall be yours when I am whole and the incantation sung!"

Vael went back in, and he and and Kronos spent some more time asking each other questions.  Kronos revealed that the [[locations/Forum of Set.md|Forum of Set]] had an entrance on the west side of the cliff face, but it was considered dangerous.  Vael told Kronos about the bodies they had found on the roof of the tower by the Forum, and Kronos was pretty sure the two humans were his former employee [[npcs/Roger.md|Roger]] and "[[npcs/Roger.md|Roger]]'s cousin", but had no idea who the halfling with them was.  He also revealed that they had found the head of [[npcs/Arden.md|Arden]] in the Forum by the oak tree, and had carried it over to the Inn to serve as their sign.  The group ultimately decided to head back to [[locations/Gosterwick.md|Gosterwick]] rather than staying at the Inn.  They made it back with their wheelbarrow full of treasure.


GM's Comments:

This was a complicated session.  One long combat against undead, then a lot of tomb raiding including a trip back to town to learn Lockmaster, and three different invisible bypasses of the halflings.  The group was pretty lucky that the piercer that achieved total surprise picked a hard target in Vallium.  Armor is good.  And they finally found the Inn of the Broken Head.


Achievements:

None


XP:

This was complicated, as they finished the previous delve this session, and then did another one.  With one PC swap between the two.

First delve:
Exploration: 10 new locations explored, good for 1 XP
Loot: Not that much, but it was enough for 1 XP
Second delve:
Exploration: 5 new locations explored, 1 XP
Loot: A massive haul, 2 XP

So those who were there for everything got 5 XP total.  Uvash was only there for the first delve and got 2 XP.  He did get a full cut of the treasure though, despite not helping haul it all out.


Next Week:

There was the usual smack talk about the halflings, but I'll believe it when I see it.  Kronos told them about another possible dungeon entrance to the Forum of [[npcs/Set.md|Set]], or maybe they'll try to explore more of [[npcs/Gog.md|Gog]]'s level, or maybe they'll confuse me and try something completely different.
