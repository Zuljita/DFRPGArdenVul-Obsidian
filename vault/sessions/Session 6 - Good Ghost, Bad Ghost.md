In [[locations/Gosterwick.md|Gosterwick]], Ioannes did some additional research into [[npcs/Lady Alexia Basileon.md|Lady Alexia Basileon]]'s Regalia and found that the Ebon Spear was the actual spear wielded by [[npcs/Arden.md|Arden]] when she was a mortal warrior hero, thousands of years ago.  Vallium again tried finding rumors about [[npcs/Phlebotomas Plumthorn.md|Phlebotomas Plumthorn]]'s halfling gang in various drinking establishments, and instead heard something about [[npcs/Ptarmis.md|Ptarmis]], a wizard who lived in the fungal caverns.

Michael was still out wandering in the wilderness, and Vael was busy studying (or possibly customizing his new wizard robes), so the group was an adventurer short this week.  They hired [[npcs/Ashe Maykum.md|Ashe Maykum]], the goat-summoning druid, from the [[factions/Grudge Brigade.md|Grudge Brigade]].  There was some discussion on whether to visit the [[locations/Great Cavern.md|Great Cavern]] again or bring food to the beastmen, but Vallium suggested avoiding the Cavern since they didn't have a wizard with Levitation to deal with cliffs and water.  Instead they would just go down the [[locations/Great Pyramid.md|Great Pyramid]] stairs and investigate unexplored parts of the Halls of [[npcs/Thoth.md|Thoth]]. 

They woke before dawn, and walked uneventfully toward [[locations/[[npcs/Arden.md|Arden]] Vul.md|[[npcs/Arden.md|Arden]] Vul]] on a warm spring day.  At the base of the waterfall, [[npcs/Ashe Maykum.md|Ashe Maykum]] used a Water Vision spell to see through all the spray, and made out a couple of cave entrances, behind the waterfall and 30 to 40 feet underwater.  While [[npcs/Ashe Maykum.md|Ashe Maykum]] was staring into the water, Ioannes noticed a crumbling tower near the side of the road, and suggested (via gestures because the waterfall was too loud for speech) that they check it out.

The group entered the remains of the tower.  The top levels had fallen, but the ground level was fairly intact.  Vallium poked around in the rubble and found what he thought was a trap door to a cellar.  [[npcs/Ashe Maykum.md|Ashe Maykum]] cast Shape Earth to help move rubble out of the way.  Vallium opened the trap door, and a terrifying ghost emerged, yelling something about Settite murderers.

Both Ioannes and Uvash fled in terror.  Vallium was a bit less scared but decided that following them made more sense than dealing with any angry ghost.  [[npcs/Ashe Maykum.md|Ashe Maykum]], however, stuck around to have a conversation.  The ghost attempted to possess [[npcs/Ashe Maykum.md|Ashe Maykum]], but failed.  It then shot some kind of magical bolt out of a finger and missed.  [[npcs/Ashe Maykum.md|Ashe Maykum]] eventually gave up on discussion and followed the others out of the tower, surrounded by goats and rats and bats.  The ghost did not pursue outside the tower.

After recovering from their fright, everyone hiked up the [[locations/Long Stair.md|Long Stair]], with Vallium pushing a new wheelbarrow containing everyone's backpacks.  Nobody slipped.  When they reached the top, the group headed toward the Pyramid of [[npcs/Thoth.md|Thoth]] and managed to avoid any encounters.  They manipulated the statue's arms, read some graffiti, and walked down several hundred stairs to the Glory of [[npcs/Thoth.md|Thoth]].  There they were greeted by their favorite halfling extortion gang, who collected 25 pieces of silver from Vallium for an Adventuring License for [[npcs/Ashe Maykum.md|Ashe Maykum]].  (Roskelly generously allowed the goats and swarms to adventure for free.)

Since [[npcs/Ashe Maykum.md|Ashe Maykum]] had Water Vision, the group headed south through the gray-green mist to the smelly murky pool, hoping the spell would reveal some treasure.  Sadly, it did not.  [[npcs/Ashe Maykum.md|Ashe Maykum]] complained about the people who failed to throw coins into fountains, and then threw a single coin in.  Vallium suggested going east to avoid beastman territory.  The group went through a previously discovered secret passage, into a room full of columns that had previously contained some flying jellyfish-like creatures.  There were 3 more of the cephalopods there this time, and they appeared hungry.

A battle ensued, but the jellyfish weren't very tough, and went down fairly quickly to a combination of Vallium's sword blows and [[npcs/Ashe Maykum.md|Ashe Maykum]]'s bat swarms.  One of them did manage to shock a goat before it died.  All the bodies in the room had already been looted, so the group headed east, then north to an unexplored door.  It was difficult to open, but Vallium got some help from Ioannes and the door opened to a long narrow north-south corridor, this one not full of corpses.  Vallium carefully checked for a way to open the door from the other side, then stepped into the passage.  Only a couple of steps in, the floor collapsed under him, revealing a 20' deep pit.  Vallium grabbed the edge of the pit and pulled himself up.  There was no obvious treasure in the pit, and the group decided that this area would be safer to explore with Levitation available.

They doubled back to the column room and took the southern exit on the east wall.  This led to a room with a lot of trash on the floor and a door on the far wall.  The door was very stuck and Vallium had a hard time opening it, so [[npcs/Ashe Maykum.md|Ashe Maykum]] sent two goats repeatedly ramming into the door until it eventually opened.  (Somehow, all the noise failed to draw any wandering monsters.)  Beyond the stuck door was a room with stone benches on every wall.  Ioannes painstakingly searched every bench, and was rewarded with a secret compartment in the last one he searched.  It contained a bolt of yellow silk, a lantern and oil, and a book written in some language that nobody knew.  They took everything.

A passage led east out of the room.  Following it, they saw a door to the south and a room to the east, and they went east into the room.  It had a mosaic of the stars on the floor, and a sky blue ceiling with stars painted on it.  [[npcs/Ashe Maykum.md|Ashe Maykum]] thought the stars were the constellation of the [[npcs/Ibis.md|Ibis]], but the others were less sure.  There were wooden stalls on the walls all around the room, with one larger stall in the middle of the eastern wall, and an exit further north on the eastern wall.  Vallium searched the larger stall, and thought there was a secret door behind it, but couldn't figure out how to open it.  Ioannes suggested searching all the stalls, and after a long search the group found a couple of potions (one of them looking magical, one not; [[npcs/Ashe Maykum.md|Ashe Maykum]] thought that was was poison), some old silver coins, a fancy ceremonial headdress, a couple more of the magical colored glass squares (green and yellow), and an ancient erotic book called The Seventy-Four Ways of Opening the [[npcs/Lotus.md|Lotus]], in Mithric, but with pictures.  Once everyone tired of looking at the book, Vallium asked for help figuring out the secret door.  Nobody could find a hidden catch or keyhole, so [[npcs/Ashe Maykum.md|Ashe Maykum]] told the two goats to again take turns ramming into the door.  After a few smashes, one of them accidentally hit a hidden catch and the door opened.

On the other side of the door was a combination bedroom and study.  A very short translucent figure sat up from the desk and warmly greeted the party with gestures.  They could not hear his voice when he tried to speak, but he apparently understood them.  He pointed at some blueprints on the desk, which said "Tomb of [[npcs/Jacobus.md|Jacobus]], the 52nd Claustral Prior of the Chapter of [[npcs/Thoth.md|Thoth]]."  There was a map there, of three rooms.  [[npcs/Jacobus.md|Jacobus]] pointed to the map then pointed to the north.  After a lot of gesturing and nodding and shaking of his head, he got the idea across that this was his tomb and his body wasn't properly buried in it for some reason and he'd like some help with that.  He then pointed to an armoire, and when they opened it, to a hat inside, and then when Ioannes looked at the hat he found it contained a key.  [[npcs/Jacobus.md|Jacobus]] pointed to the key and then led the group out the secret door, north, east down a passage to a looted storeroom.  [[npcs/Jacobus.md|Jacobus]] pointed to the north wall, then to the key, until the PCs searched and found a secret door.

A short passage led north, then jagged left a bit and suspiciuously dead-ended.  Everyone searched for a secret door in the obvious place, and found one.  [[npcs/Jacobus.md|Jacobus]] had stayed behind in the storeroom.  Vallium figured out how to open the secret door, and stepped through.

On the other side was a room full of burial niches and sarcophagi, many of them looted and destroyed.  A couple of ghouls were charging toward the party.  They decided to let the ghouls come to them, allowing a retreat through the secret door if needed.  This tactic lasted a couple of seconds before [[npcs/Ashe Maykum.md|Ashe Maykum]] decided to send his goats and bat and rat swarms into the room to draw attacks.  Two ghouls were visible at first, and later five more ghouls and a wight were spotted.  [[npcs/Ashe Maykum.md|Ashe Maykum]] cast a Hail spell between the undead and the party, which meant the undead had to take Hail damage in addition to swarm damage before they could hurt anyone important.  It was a long grinding fight, but ultimately Vallium's sword and the swarms took down all of the undead.  The ghouls landed a couple of hits on Vallium, but failed to penetrate his armor.  The undead managed to kill a couple of the swarms, but [[npcs/Ashe Maykum.md|Ashe Maykum]] said that was fine and he could just make more.

With the undead gone, the party investigated the room.  There were open double doors to the southwest, facing the [[locations/Great Chasm.md|Great Chasm]].  There was a single tomb with a fancy gisant to the northeast.  And there was a rather short skeleton on the ground near the east wall.  Ioannes went back to get the blueprints, which showed where the secret door leading to [[npcs/Jacobus.md|Jacobus]]'s tomb should be.  The group found the secret door in the expected spot, went in, and found an unoccupied sarcophagus and a bunch of treasure.  Vallium reverently put [[npcs/Jacobus.md|Jacobus]]'s skeleton in the sarcophagus, as both Uvash and Ioannes said a few appropriate words.  [[npcs/Jacobus.md|Jacobus]]'s ghost came running into the room, bowed to everyone, and dived into the sarcophagus on top of his skeleton.  Before disappearing, he pointed to the side of the sarcophagus.  Uvash thought [[npcs/Jacobus.md|Jacobus]] was just saying to close it, but Vallium thought he might be pointing to something, and searched.  There was a secret compartment there, containing a belt and a ring.

The party picked up all the portable treasure from the tomb.  This included a locked chest.  [[npcs/Ashe Maykum.md|Ashe Maykum]] suggested smashing it with goats, but Uvash said that if there was anything fragile inside that might smash it, so they decided to just take the chest and pay someone in [[locations/Gosterwick.md|Gosterwick]] to open it.

Discussion of the chest made everyone remember the halflings.  Vallium mentioned maybe just giving them their 10% for once, but [[npcs/Ashe Maykum.md|Ashe Maykum]] scoffed and suggested using Mystic Mist instead.  The plan was to approch the Glory of [[npcs/Thoth.md|Thoth]] from the northwest entrance, only 10 yards from the stairs up to the pyramid, then cast a big Mystic Mist over the whole northeast corner of the room, and march the treasure out while the halflings were confused by the mist.  One of Roskelly's fighters saw the mist appear, and Roskelly sent a couple of halflings in to investigate, but both ran back out screaming, and then the PCs were up the stairs,  Roskelly was yelling after them, though; this time the halflings knew they'd been cheated of their share of the loot.


GM's Comments:

Three fights this week: quickly running away from a ghost, quickly dispatching some chasm cephalopods, and then a long grindy fight against some ghouls and a wight.  Only Vallium and [[npcs/Ashe Maykum.md|Ashe Maykum]] got to do much, but the PCs won.  Summoned swarms are pretty powerful, but more combatants mean slower combats.  They found a lot of treasure in Prior [[npcs/Jacobus.md|Jacobus]]'s tomb, and only had to split it 4 ways, so it was a profitable delve.


Achievements:

Quest: Prior [[npcs/Jacobus.md|Jacobus]]'s Ghost


XP:

Exploration: 10 new locations explored, for 1 XP.
Loot: That locked (and trapped!) chest was full of coins.  2 XP.
Achievements: 1 XP for giving Prior [[npcs/Jacobus.md|Jacobus]] a proper burial.


Next week:

The party has progressed from sneaking treasure past the halflings in deniable ways to brazenly walking treasure past them with obvious magic.  We'll see if they return to the scene of the crime or decide to go somewhere else.

Ioannes spent some time reading the Book of Priors the group had found in their last delve.  It was thousands of pages long, written in dense Mithric by a succession of Priors of [[npcs/Thoth.md|Thoth]], over the years 937 to 1782 AEP.  Amidst all the church records, he found about twelve levels of the Halls described.  There was also mention of two different species conquered by the great Archon Marius Tricodor: the varumani (big strong regenerators) and the heqeti (demon-worshipping amphibians).  He also managed to find a spare healing kit at the Temple of [[npcs/Demma.md|Demma]] and made a donation to have it reassigned to him.

Vallium went looking for rumors of [[npcs/Phlebotomas Plumthorn.md|Phlebotomas Plumthorn]]'s halflings, and heard that they were selling "exploration licenses" (confirmed!) and also that messing with them was a bad idea because they had magic wands.

Vael was still tied up in magical research and/or getting his new robes to look right, but Michael had returned from his latest trip into the wilderness.  Short a mage, the group hired the [[factions/Grudge Brigade.md|Grudge Brigade]] leader [[npcs/Coinbase.md|Coinbase]] again, since he was available and definitely good at selling treasure, as well as allegedly being able to cast some spells.

The party woke up before dawn on a rainy Demmasday and trudged the usual several hours toward the Ruins.  Nobody slipped on the [[locations/Long Stair.md|Long Stair]], but a very brave or very hungry mountain lion decided that Vallium, at the back of the group, looked like a nice meal, and pounced on him from behind.  It managed to bite him hard in the back of the neck, but did not account for how thick his armor was, and mostly just hurt its teeth.  Vallium stabbed the big cat to death, and [[npcs/Coinbase.md|Coinbase]] reminded them that his minion Goat would pay for corpses of animals he hadn't previously seen, so they stuck the body behind some trees and hoped it would still be there when they returned.

Continuing up the [[locations/Long Stair.md|Long Stair]] to the Ruins, the group had a brief discussion on where to go.  They didn't feel ready to fight the halflings (though as usual they spent some time talking smack about them).  Vallium suggested exploring the islands in the middle of the Upper [[locations/Swift River.md|Swift River]].  Ioannes and [[npcs/Coinbase.md|Coinbase]] mentioned exploring some more of the ruined city wall and its guard towers.  They compromised by starting with the towers since they were closer, planning to visit the islands later.

Heading east from the entry into the ruins, they inspected a crumbling piece of city wall, then found a mostly intact round tower in the southeast corner.  Four of them were able to climb the more stable looking wall to the east of the tower, but [[npcs/Coinbase.md|Coinbase]] failed to climb it and doubled back to the ruined wall to the west, which was easier to climb but looked more likely to collapse.  The two groups entered the tower from opposite sides, and were able to see each other across the mostly empty upper floor of the tower.  They heard noise above, like loud chittering birds.  As they entered the tower, several stirges dove down from above to defend their lair.  The angry birds fought without any tactical sense, just charging at the nearest intruder.  Vallium and Michael swatted a couple down, while [[npcs/Coinbase.md|Coinbase]] summoned a semi-illusionary [[npcs/Phantom.md|Phantom]].  With three of the stirges dead, the others decided to retreat, and they were too fast to catch.  The group searched the tower but found no treasure.  They grabbed a strix corpse to sell to Goat.

Continuing north, they found a ruined square tower containing a large bees nest.  Giving the nest a wide berth, they saw another square tower ahead, and spotted a pig-headed beastman peeking around the corner of the tower at them.  They approached warily, but by the time they summoned the courage to peek around the tower, the beastman was nowhere to be seen.

There was a break in the city's eastern wall, and then another square tower ahead.  When the group got within about 20 yards of the tower, a large white baboon stuck its head out a window and hooted at them, then threw a rock at Vallium.  The rock missed.  A lot of hooting ensued in the tower, and a couple more rocks.  Some more hooting answered from a cistern east of the tower.  The group discussed rushing the baboons, then decided that wasn't a great idea, and backed away.

There was a semi-intact ruin of a manor house to the west.  Most of the group spent about an hour digging through it, while Vallium stood guard.  They didn't find anything particularly interesting; maybe this ruin had already been picked over.  While they were searching, a wyvern flew by to the south, took a good look at them, then flew off to the west.  This time, it didn't try to drop anything on them.

At this point they decided to head northwest and explore the islands.  There was a foot bridge leading from west of the forum to the southern island.  The bridge was only about five feet wide and appeared to be made of iron, so it was impressive that it was still standing.  With some caution they crossed it, and it did not collapse.  They continued north through some nondescript ruins until they saw a ruined palace, with some kind of domed greenhouse still standing in its east wing.  The front doors were also still standing, about fifteen feet tall and black.  As they approached the door, a voice shouted out in Mithric "Stand aside, citizen.  This is not your home."  They tried talking to whoever was inside, but got no answer.  Eventually the voice repeated the same line again, and they decided it was pre-programmed rather than someone actually talking.

The front doors looked sturdy, but parts of the wall had collapsed, so they went around.  They walked into a ruined antechamber that held a couple of desiccated corpses, but no treasure.  They went east to the greenhouse, which was surprisingly intact.  It was about four stories tall, with catwalks crisscrossing the building, a transparent roof that let light in, and plants and even a few trees everywhere.  There was a fountain in the center of the greenhouse, still working.  They poked around looking for something of interest, and something of interest found them.

An assassin vine, basically a human-sized pitcher plant with a couple dozen tendrils for dragging prey into its maw, greeted them with a couple of tendrils each.  They were surprised by this and stood around watching for a couple of seconds while the tendrils grabbed most of them.  Ioannes was as surprised as the rest of them, but he was wearing the Ring of Free Action they found in the Priors' hoard, and the tendrils were unable to get a good grip on him.  Michael, though theoretically as surprised as the rest of them, showed off his Combat Reflexes by rolling a natural 3 on his dodge, jumping away from both tendrils and also snapping out of stun.

The assassin vine was very strong, and managed to knock both Vallium and Uvash prone and drag them forward toward its mouth.  However, the tendrils were not very tough, and everyone started chopping them to release their friends.  Michael chopped the tendril holding [[npcs/Coinbase.md|Coinbase]], freeing the elf to cast a [[npcs/Phantom.md|Phantom]], which fooled the not-very-smart plant that it was real, and started ripping off tendrils. Ioannes chopped a tendril off Vallium.  Vallium started cutting the tendrils grabbing him, but as the plant dragged him within range of his body, decided to concentrate on the larger target instead, and hit the plant's body hard enough to stun it, causing it to release its grappled victims.  With the plant stunned, Michael ran up, and he and Vallium stabbed the plant from both sides enough to make it stop moving.  The whole group then spent some time making sure it was dead.

Near the dead plant, the group spotted the ancient corpse of what looked like a noble woman.  Ioannes tried to diagnose the cause of death, but the body was too old.  However, there was some kind of huge rod of office, and a platinum circlet, and a signet ring, and a shortsword.  Ioannes was pretty sure both the rod and the sword were magical.  They searched the corpse and also found a few rubies, a key, three small silver ankhs, and a fist-sized chunk of orange rock, which Ioannes thought was magical and the group suspected might be the rumored [[items/Arcanum.md|Arcanum]].

After looting the body, the group checked out the fountain, but didn't find anything interesting in it.  They continued to the east of the solarium, and ran smack into another plant creature.  This one was a big smelly bipedal slimy mess.  This fight was a lot faster than the previous one, Vallium hit it quickly and got if off-balance, and then he and Michael and [[npcs/Coinbase.md|Coinbase]]'s [[npcs/Phantom.md|Phantom]] triple-teamed it.  Ioannes cast Flaming Weapon on Vallium's sword, but the fire didn't seem to do anything to the soggy plant.  However, by then the [[npcs/Phantom.md|Phantom]] had pinned it to the ground, and Vallium and Michael were taking turns chopping off large bits of plant matter.  Uvash joined in and smacked it with his mace and finished it off.  The Shambling Mound had no treasure.

Leaving the solarium and returning to the ruined palace, Ioannes found a magical ring of paving stones, about 6' in diameter, with a rectangular grid of 6 8" by 8" squares nearby.  Vallium asked if the squares were the same size as the glass squares they had found.  They didn't have the glass squares with them, but they looked about the same size.  They searched the palace a bit more, and Uvash found a tapestry of a hunt in decent condition, but otherwise they found no other treasure.

After leaving the place through the hole in the wall, they saw larger bridges east (back toward the forum) and west (to the west side of the [[locations/Swift River.md|Swift River]].)  To the east was a plinth with the feet of a large statue, but the rest of the statue was nowhere to be seen.  They crossed and took a closer look, and the feet were sculpted with heavy boots, possibly representing armor.  Someone asked if the feet matched the statue part they'd found in a basin to the east, and they appeared to be about the same scale and material, but since this was feet and the other part was an arm and hand, it would not be possible to fit them together and be sure.

Heading back south toward the [[locations/Long Stair.md|Long Stair]], Vallium suggested stopping at the obelisk to see if the silver ankhs they'd found matched the indentations on the obelisk.  Sure enough, all three ankhs matched.  However, inserting one didn't cause anything obvious to happen.  They reclaimed the ankh rather than leaving it in the obelisk.  They tend continued south to the [[locations/Long Stair.md|Long Stair]].  The mountain lion corpse was still where they left it, so they put it in the wheelbarrow and dragged it home for sale.


GM's Notes:

I don't think I ran the stirges very well.  One problem with random encounters is the GM doesn't know what's going to happen until it does, so there's not a lot of time to review the monster description -- but I should do it anyway.  It's worth burning 5 minutes at the start of a long fight to make the rest of the fight run more correctly and smoothly.

The assassin vine, though, worked pretty well.  It was the first monster to achieve decisive surprise against this party.  Fortunately for them, it's not a fast killer -- it takes a while to grapple its victims, then knock them down, then drag them toward its maw, then digest them.

I rolled for whether the shambling mound heard the fight with the assassin vine and decided to join in.  Fortunately for the PCs, it did not.  Getting tag-teamed by both of them at once would have been much harder than fighting them one at a time ended up being.  This week demonstrated that dumb monsters do not always have the best tactics.

Amusingly, none of the monsters they found this session had any treasure (unless you count their bodies), but the dead noble lady's body in the Solarium had a bunch of it.


Achievements:

The Archon's Palace was an [[locations/[[npcs/Arden.md|Arden]] Vul.md|[[npcs/Arden.md|Arden]] Vul]] Iconic Location

XP: 
Exploration: 6 new locations explored, good for 1 XP
Loot: The rubies and platinum circlet they found will be enough for 1 XP each.  If they want to hit the 2 XP bonus loot threshold, they'll need to sell the dead noblewoman's magic rod and/or magic shortsword.  Based on past behavior, they'll probably do that, after identifying them.
Achievements: 1 XP

Next week:

There was more smack talk about the halflings.  We'll see if they actually decide to fight them, or if they keep exploring other areas.

All the Ways the PCs Know They Can Go in [[locations/[[npcs/Arden.md|Arden]] Vul.md|[[npcs/Arden.md|Arden]] Vul]]
One of the players posted a list of all the ways they could explore next on the campaign Discord.  Here's a shortened version:



2 caves behind the waterfall (beneath 35-40' of rough water)
Ruined tower near the base of the waterfall (ghost)
Secret entrance 2/3 of the way up the [[locations/Long Stair.md|Long Stair]], leading to the [[locations/Great Cavern.md|Great Cavern]]
Ruins of the city of [[locations/[[npcs/Arden.md|Arden]] Vul.md|[[npcs/Arden.md|Arden]] Vul]]
Northern island
Multiple watch towers
Square tower near Forum with bronze double doors
Square tower (bees)
Square tower and cistern (baboons)
Down the Well of Light (baboons and giant 4-armed baboons)
Pyramid of [[npcs/Thoth.md|Thoth]], move statue west 
Halls of [[npcs/Thoth.md|Thoth]] (halflings)
[[locations/Great Chasm.md|Great Chasm]]
Lever on top of triangular pyramid, teleporter to Well of Light
Beastman territory
Stairs down, behind secret door in baboon mosaic
Chute down, opened by manipulating a statue
Pyramid of [[npcs/Thoth.md|Thoth]], move statue east
Black portal (demons)
[[npcs/Selket.md|Selket]] statue, teleporter to [[locations/Great Hall.md|Great Hall]] (beastmen)

At least so far, [[locations/[[npcs/Arden.md|Arden]] Vul.md|[[npcs/Arden.md|Arden]] Vul]] has a large branching factor.  The PCs choose where to explore, and then instead of having one less choice (as they would if they exhausted a dead end), they usually find a couple more choices.

This makes prepping the dungeon more difficult for the GM, because I can't always guess where players will go next, so I have to have a lot of areas prepared.  This is probably good though, because it gives me incentive to prep more each week, so I'll finish prepping the whole adventure sooner.

I think having a lot of choices is good for players, because if they get stuck in one place they can go somewhere else.  However, it does require players to have good memories, or take good notes, or buy Eidetic Memory, so they don't forget about all those loose ends.
