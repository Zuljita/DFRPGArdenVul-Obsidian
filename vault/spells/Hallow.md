# Hallow

- **College:** Meta
- **Type:** Area
- **Base Cost:** 5
- **Casting Time:** 1 hour
- **Duration:** Permanent
- **Prerequisite:** PI 5

Increases the Sanctity (for clerics) or Nature's Strength (for druids) of an area by one level, to a maximum of High Sanctity or +3 Nature's Strength.

This may only be cast in an appropriate area, such as a temple of the appropriate god for a cleric, or a particularly nice natural area for a druid. It can be used in an opposing temple to reduce its sanctity for the opposing religion, but only to Normal sanctity; getting to High would require extensive changes to the temple.
