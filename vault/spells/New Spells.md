# New Spells

This document contains descriptions of various new spells, detailing their effects, costs, and prerequisites.

## [[Curse Item]]
- **College:** Enchantment
- **Duration:** permanent
- **Cost:** 10
- **Casting time:** 1 hour
- **Prerequisite:** Enchant
- **Effect:** Gives an item a minor malevolent effect. The caster and others they specify at the time of casting are unaffected. Magic items resist.

## [[Basil's Torch Treatment]]
- **College:** Fire
- **Cost:** 1
- **Prerequisite:** Create Fire
- **Effect:** Triples the lifespan of a torch (normally from 1 hour to 3 hours).

## [[The Bracteros Effect]]
- **College:** Light and Darkness
- **Duration:** 1 hour
- **Cost:** 4 to cast, 2 to maintain
- **Prerequisite:** Invisibility
- **Effect:** Renders a light source invisible to those more than 7 hexes away from it.

## [[Frigg's Elephant Ears]]
- **College:** Mind Control
- **Type:** Regular; R-Will
- **Cost:** 2
- **Duration:** 10 minutes
- **Prerequisite:** Sense Emotion
- **Effect:** Causes the subject's ears to grow to elephant size if they lie. They will droop and flap if they tell additional lies.

## [[Perpetual Light]]
- **College:** Light and Darkness
- **Type:** Regular
- **Duration:** Permanent
- **Cost:** 6 for moonlight, 12 for torchlight, 18 for daylight.
- **Prerequisite:** Continual Light
- **Effect:** Makes a small object (or a small part of a large object) glow permanently. The light will be orange. A small amount of [[Arcanum]] is required to cast this spell, and is consumed. This is not an enchantment so it can be dispelled, is destroyed by no mana zones, etc.

## [[The Hekate's Bonds]]
- **College:** Body Control
- **Type:** Regular; R-HT
- **Duration:** 5s (Cannot be maintained)
- **Cost:** 8
- **Prerequisite:** Total Paralysis
- **Effect:** Causes paralysis.

## [[Brain Full of Small Spiders]]
- **College:** Illusion; R-Will
- **Duration:** 1 minute. Can't be maintained.
- **Cost:** 3
- **Prerequisite:** Perfect Illusion, Itch
- **Effect:** Creates a sensation that spiders are crawling on the subject's head. Causes -1 to all rolls and half movement.

## [[Frigg's Jelly Legs]]
- **College:** Body Control
- **Type:** Regular; R-HT
- **Cost:** 2
- **Duration:** 1 minute
- **Prerequisite:** Clumsiness
- **Effect:** The target's legs become rubbery and unstable. They suffer Bad Footing (-2 to hit, -1 to defend, +1 movement point per hex) for the duration of the spell. If they're already suffering from Bad Footing, the effects are cumulative.

## [[Hallow]]
- **College:** Meta
- **Type:** Area
- **Base Cost:** 5
- **Casting Time:** 1 hour
- **Duration:** Permanent
- **Prerequisite:** PI 5
- **Effect:** Increases the Sanctity (cleric) or Nature's Strength (druid) of the area by one level, to a maximum of High Sanctity or +3 Nature's Strength. This may only be cast in an appropriate area, such as a temple of the appropriate god for a cleric, or a particularly nice natural area for a druid. It can be used in an opposing temple to reduce its sanctity for the opposing religion, but only to Normal sanctity; getting to High would require extensive changes to the temple.

## [[Frigg's Fraud]]
- **College:** Illusion
- **Duration:** Permanent
- **Cost:** 2
- **Prerequisite:** Simple Illusion
- **Effect:** Causes a magic item to be undetectable by Magery at range. Detecting it with Magery by touch or with spells like Detect Magic requires a Quick Contest with the spell.
