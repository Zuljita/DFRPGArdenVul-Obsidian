# Perpetual Light

- **College:** Light and Darkness
- **Type:** Regular
- **Duration:** Permanent
- **Cost:** 6 for moonlight, 12 for torchlight, 18 for daylight.
- **Prerequisite:** Continual Light

Makes a small object (or a small part of a large object) glow permanently with an orange light. A small amount of arcanum is required to cast this spell and is consumed.

This does not count as a spell "on" the object, so it can be dispelled and is destroyed by no-mana zones.
